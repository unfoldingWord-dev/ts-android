translationStudio Android
--

A tool to translate the Bible and [Open Bible Stories](https://unfoldingword.org/stories) into your own language. You can read more about the purpose of this project at [unfoldingWord](https://unfoldingword.org/apps/#tS).

## Requirements
The official development requirements are available at
* [tS Requirements](https://github.com/unfoldingWord-dev/ts-requirements)

Additional documentation specific to the android platform is available in the [wiki].

## Contributing
If you would like to contribute to this project please read the [Contributing](https://github.com/unfoldingWord-dev/ts-android/wiki/Contributing) article in the wiki.

## Quck Start
First make sure you have all the dependencies installed

* [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
* [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/) (you may skip this and the rest of these steps if using a physical device)
* [Genymotion](http://www.genymotion.com/)
* [Genymotion Android Studio Plugin](https://cloud.genymotion.com/page/doc/#collapse-intellij)

Then fork this repository and clone your fork. After the repository has been cloned to your computer create a new Genymotion emulator. These emulators are faster and have better features that the stock emulators that come with the Androd SDK. As always a physical device will provide the best experience if you have one.

API 15 is currently the standard minimum sdk version so it is likely you will have it once [Android Studio] has been installed. If not then you will need to download it following the instructions in [Adding SDK Packages].

For more information please read the [wiki].

## Building
translationStudio relies on several native libraries. Therefore when building for a device or emulator you must choose the correct build varient for that platform. In Android Studio you can change the build varients by clicking on the `Build Variants` tab in the lower left corner of the IDE window. This will display an embeded window in which you can choose the correct build variant for the `app` module.

In most cases you should use the `x86Debug` variant for emulators and the `fatDebug` variant for physical devices.

## Updating the content
To update the content use the [Door43 Client](https://github.com/unfoldingWord-dev/node-door43-client) to index and download the content from the API. While doing so be sure to download "closed" resource containers. See the tool help documentation for details.

After you've finished building the index you'll need to edit the sqlite file. Open the file in a sqlite editor and change the "User Version" pragma from `0` to `1`.

Next you must zip the resource containers. Do so by entering the directory containing the resource containers and running the following on linux `zip -r ../containers.zip ./*`.

Finally, replace `index.sqlite` and `containers.zip` in the codebase.

## Included Resources
The application is bundled with resources from the following languages

ar, as, bn, ceb, el-x-koine, en, es-419, fr, gu, hbo, hi, hr, id, ilo, kn, ml, mr, ne, or, pa, pt-br, ru, sw, ta, te, th, tl, vi
