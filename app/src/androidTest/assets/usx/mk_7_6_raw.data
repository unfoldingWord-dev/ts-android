<verse number="6" style="v" />But he said to them, "Isaiah prophesied well about you hypocrites, he wrote,</para>
<para style="q1">'This people honors me with their lips,</para>
<para style="q1">but their heart is far from me.</para>
<para style="q1">
<verse number="7" style="v" />Empty worship they offer me,</para>
<para style="q1">teaching the rules of men as their doctrines.'
