    1This is the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. 
 
    2As it is written in Isaiah the prophet,  
     "Look, I am sending my messenger before you,  
    the one who will prepare your way. 
  3The voice of someone calling out in the wilderness,  
    'Make ready the way of the Lord; make his paths straight.'"
