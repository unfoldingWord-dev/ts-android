\s5
\cl Psalm 
\c 1
\p
\q
\v 1 Blessed is the man who does not walk in the advice of the wicked,
\q or stand in the pathway with sinners,
\q or sit in the assembly of mockers.
\q
\v 2 But his delight is in the law of Yahweh,
\q and on his law he meditates day and night.

\s5
\q
\v 3 He will be like a tree planted by the streams of water
\q that produces its fruit in its season,
\q whose leaves do not wither;
\q whatever he does will prosper.

\s5
\q
\v 4 The wicked are not so,
\q but are instead like the chaff that the wind drives away.
\q
\v 5 So the wicked will not stand in the judgment,
\q nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.

\s5
\q
\v 6 For Yahweh approves of the way of the righteous,
\q but the way of the wicked will perish.




\s5
\c 2
\p
\q
\v 1 Why are the nations in rebellion,
\q and the peoples conspire in vain ?
\q
\v 2 The kings of the earth take their stand together
\q and the rulers conspire together
\q against Yahweh and against his Messiah, saying,
\q
\v 3 "Let us tear off the shackles they put on us
\q and throw off their chains."

\s5
\q
\v 4 He who sits in the heavens will sneer at them;
\q the Lord mocks them.
\q
\v 5 Then he will speak to them in his anger
\q and terrify them in his rage, saying,

\s5
\q
\v 6 "I myself have anointed my king
\q on Zion, my holy mountain."
\q
\v 7 I will announce a decree of Yahweh.
\q He said to me, "You are my son!
\q This day I have become your father.

\s5
\q
\v 8 Ask  me, and I will give you the nations for your inheritance
\q and the farthermost regions of the earth for your possession.
\q
\v 9 You will break them with an iron scepter;
\q you will smash like a potter’s jar."
\b

\s5
\q
\v 10 So now, you kings, be warned;
\q be corrected, you rulers of the earth.
\q
\v 11 Worship Yahweh in fear
\q and rejoice with trembling.

\s5
\q
\v 12 Give true allegiance to his son so that he will not be angry with you, and so you will not die
\q when his anger quickly ignites.
\q Blessed are all those who take shelter in him.




\s5
\c 3
\d A psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son.
\b
\q
\v 1 Yahweh, how many are my enemies!
\q Many have turned away and attacked me.
\q
\v 2 Many say about me,
\q "There is no help for him from God." 
\qs Selah\qs*

\s5
\q
\v 3 But you, Yahweh, are a shield around me,
\q my glory, and the one who lifts up my head.
\q
\v 4 I lift up my voice to Yahweh,
\q and he answers me from his holy hill. 
\qs Selah\qs*

\s5
\q
\v 5 I lay down and slept;
\q   I awoke, for Yahweh protected me.
\q
\v 6 I will not be afraid of the multitudes of people
\q who have set themselves against me on every side.

\s5
\q
\v 7 Rise up, Yahweh! Save me, my God!
\q For you will hit all my enemies on the jaw;
\q you will break the teeth of the wicked.
\q
\v 8 Salvation comes from Yahweh.
\q  May your blessings be on your people. 
\qs Selah\qs*



\s5
\c 4
\d For the chief musician; on stringed instruments. A psalm of David.
\b
\q
\v 1 Answer me when I call, God of my righteousness;
\q give me room when I am hemmed in.
\q Have mercy on me and listen to my prayer.

\s5
\q
\v 2 You people, how long will you turn my honor into shame?
\q How long will you love that which is worthless and seek after lies?
\qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 3 But know that Yahweh sets apart the godly for himself.
\q Yahweh will hear when I call to him.

\s5
\q
\v 4 Tremble in fear, but do not sin!
\q Meditate in your heart on your bed and be silent. 
\qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 5 Offer the sacrifices of righteousness
\q and put your trust in Yahweh.

\s5
\q
\v 6 Many say, "Who will show us anything good?"
\q Yahweh, lift  up the light of your face on us.
\q
\v 7 You have given my heart more gladness
\q  than others have when their grain and new wine abound.
\q
\v 8 It is in peace that I will lie down and sleep,
\q for you alone, Yahweh, make me safe and secure.




\s5
\c 5
\d For the chief musician; with wind instruments. A psalm of David.
\b
\q
\v 1 Listen to my call to you, Yahweh;
\q  think about my groanings.
\q
\v 2 Listen to the sound of my call, my King and my God,
\q for it is to you that I pray.
\q
\v 3 Yahweh, in the morning you hear my cry;
\q in the morning I will bring my petiton to you and wait expectantly.

\s5
\q
\v 4 Certainly you are not a God who approves of evil;
\q evil people will not be your guests.
\q
\v 5 The arrogant will not stand in your presence;
\q you hate all who behave wickedly.
\q
\v 6 You will destroy liars;
\q Yahweh despises violent and deceitful men.

\s5
\q
\v 7 But as for me, because of your great covenant faithfulness, I will come into your house;
\q in reverence I will bow down toward your holy temple.
\q
\v 8 Oh Lord, lead me in your righteousness because of my enemies;
\q make your path straight before me.

\s5
\q
\v 9 For there is no truth in their mouth;
\q their inward being is wicked;
\q their throat is an open sepulchre;
\q they flatter with their tongue.
\q
\v 10 Declare them guilty, God;
\q may their schemes be their downfall!
\q Drive them out for their many transgressions,
\q for they have rebelled against you.

\s5
\q
\v 11 But may all those who take refuge in you rejoice;
\q let them always shout for joy because you defend them;
\q let them be joyful in you, those who love your name.
\q
\v 12 For you will bless the righteous, Yahweh;
\q you will surround them with favor as with a shield.




\s5
\c 6
\d For the chief musician; on stringed instruments, set to the Sheminith style. A psalm of David.
\b
\q
\v 1 Yahweh, do not rebuke me in your anger
\q or discipline me in your wrath.
\q
\v 2 Have mercy on me, Yahweh, for I am frail;
\q heal me, Yahweh, for my bones are shaking.

\s5
\q
\v 3 My soul also is very troubled.
\q But you, Yahweh—how long will this continue?
\q
\v 4 Return, Yahweh! rescue me.
\q Save me because of your covenant faithfulness!
\q
\v 5 For in death there is no remembrance of you.
\q In sheol who will give you thanks?

\s5
\q
\v 6 I am weary with my groaning.
\q All night I drench my bed with tears;
\q I wash my couch away with my tears.
\q
\v 7 My eyes grow  dim from grief;
\q they grow weak because of all my adversaries.

\s5
\q
\v 8 Get away from me, all you who practice iniquity;
\q for Yahweh has heard the sound of my weeping.
\q
\v 9 Yahweh has heard my appeal for mercy;
\q Yahweh has accepted my prayer.
\q
\v 10  All my enemies will be ashamed  and greatly troubled.
\q They will turn back and  be suddenly humiliated.




\s5
\c 7
\d A musical composition of David, which he sang to Yahweh concerning the words of Cush the Benjamite.
\b
\q
\v 1 Yahweh my God, I take refuge in you!
\q Save me from all who chase me, and rescue me.
\q
\v 2 Otherwise, they will rip me apart like a lion,
\q tearing me in pieces with no one else able to bring me to safety.

\s5
\q
\v 3 Yahweh my God, I never did what my enemies say I did;
\q there is no injustice on my hands.
\q
\v 4 I have never done wrong to anyone at peace with me,
\q or senselessly harmed any who are against me.

\s5
\q
\v 5 If I am not telling the truth then let my enemy pursue my life and overtake it;
\q  let him trample my living body on the ground
\q and leave me lying dishonored in the dust. 
\qs Selah\qs*

\s5
\q
\v 6 Arise, Yahweh, in your anger;
\q  stand up against the rage of my enemies;
\q wake up for my sake and carry out the righteous decrees that you have commanded for them.
\q
\v 7 The countries are assembled all around you;
\q take once more your rightful place over them.

\s5
\q
\v 8 Yahweh, judge the nations;
\q vindicate me, Yahweh, because I am righteous and innocent, Most High.
\q
\v 9 May the evil deeds of the wicked come to an end, but establish the righteous people,
\q righteous God, you who examine hearts and minds.

\s5
\q
\v 10 My shield comes from God,
\q the one who saves the upright in heart.
\q
\v 11 God is a righteous judge,
\q a God who is indignant each day.

\s5
\q
\v 12 If a person does not repent, God will sharpen his sword
\q and will prepare his bow for battle.
\q
\v 13 He prepares to use weapons against him;
\q he makes his arrows flaming shafts.

\s5
\q
\v 14 Think about the one who is pregnant with wickedness,
\q who conceives destructive plans, who gives birth to harmful lies.
\q
\v 15 He digs a pit and hollows it out
\q and then falls into the hole he has made.
\q
\v 16 His own destructive plans return to his own head,
\q for his violence comes down on his own head.

 \s5
\q
\v 17 I will give thanks to Yahweh for his justice;
\q I will sing praise to Yahweh Most High.



\s5
\c 8
\d For the chief musician; set to the gittith style. A psalm of David.
\b
\q
\v 1 Yahweh our Lord, how magnificent is your name in all the earth,
\q you who reveal your glory in the heavens above.
\q
\v 2 Out of the mouth of babies and infants you have created praise
\q because of your adversaries,
\q in order to silence both the enemy and the avenger.

\s5
\q
\v 3 When I look up at your heavens, which your fingers have made,
\q the moon and the stars, which you have set in place,
\q
\v 4 Of what importance is the human race that you notice them,
\q or mankind that you pay attention to them?
\q
\v 5 Yet you have made them only a little lower than the heavenly beings
\q and have crowned them with glory and honor.

\s5
\q
\v 6 You make him to rule over the works of your hands;
\q you have put all things under his feet:
\q
\v 7 all sheep and oxen,
\q and even the animals of the field,
\q
\v 8 the birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea,
\q everything that  passes through the currents of the seas.

\s5
\q
\v 9 Yahweh our Lord,
\q how magnificent  is your name in all the earth!



\s5
\c 9
\q
\d For the chief musician; set to Muth Labben. A psalm of David.
\b
\q
\v 1 I will give thanks to Yahweh with my whole heart;
\q I will tell about all your marvelous deeds.
\q
\v 2 I will be glad and rejoice in you;
\q I will sing praise to your name, Most High!

\s5
\q
\v 3 When my enemies turn back,
\q they stumble and perish before you.
\q
\v 4 For you have defended my just cause;
\q you sit on your throne, a righteous judge!

\s5
\q
\v 5 You terrified the nations with your battle cry; 
\q you have destroyed the wicked;
\q you have blotted out their memory forever.
\q
\v 6 The enemy crumbled like ruins 
\q  when you overthrew their cities.
\q All remembrance of them has perished.

\s5
\q
\v 7 But Yahweh remains forever;
\q he establishes his throne for justice.
\q
\v 8 He judges the world fairly.
\q He makes just decisions for the nations.

\s5
\q
\v 9 Yahweh also will be a stronghold for the oppressed,
\q a stronghold in times of trouble.
\q
\v 10 Those who know your name trust in you,
\q for you, Yahweh, do not abandon those who seek you.

\s5
\q
\v 11 Sing praises to Yahweh, who rules in Zion;
\q tell the nations what he has done.
\q
\v 12 For the God who avenges bloodshed remembers;
\q he does not forget the cry of the oppressed.

\s5
\q
\v 13 Have mercy on me, Yahweh; see how I am oppressed by those who hate me,
\q you who can snatch me from the gates of death.
\q
\v 14 Oh, that I might proclaim all your praise.
\q In the gates of the daughter of Zion
\q I will rejoice in your salvation!

\s5
\q
\v 15 The nations have sunk down into the pit that they made;
\q their feet are caught in the net that they hid.
\q
\v 16 Yahweh has made himself known; he has executed judgment;
\q the wicked is ensnared by his own actions. 
\qs Selah\qs*

\s5
\q
\v 17 The wicked are turned back and sent to sheol,
\q the destiny of all the nations that forget God.
\q
\v 18 For the needy will not always be forgotten,
\q nor will the hopes of the oppressed be forever dashed.

\s5
\q
\v 19 Arise, Yahweh; do not let man conquer us;
\q may the nations be judged in your sight.
\q
\v 20 Terrify them, Yahweh;
\q may the nations know that they are mere men. 
\qs Selah\qs*



\s5
\c 10
\p
\q
\v 1 Why, Yahweh, do you stand far off?
\q Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?
\q
\v 2 Because of their arrogance, wicked people chase the oppressed;
\q but please let the wicked be trapped by their own schemes that they have devised.
\q
\v 3 For the wicked person boasts of his deepest desires;
\q he blesses the greedy and insults Yahweh.

\s5
\q
\v 4 Because the wicked man is so proud, he does not seek God.
\q He never thinks about God because he does not care at all about him.
\q
\v 5 He is secure at all times,
\q but your righteous decrees are too high for him;
\q he snorts at all his enemies.

\s5
\q
\v 6 He says in his heart," I will never fail;
\q throughout all generations I will not meet adversity."
\q
\v 7 His mouth is full of cursing and deceptive, harmful words;
\q his tongue injures and destroys.

\s5
\q
\v 8 He waits in ambush near the villages;
\q in the secret places he murders the innocent;
\q his eyes look for some helpless victim.
\q
\v 9 He lurks in secret like a lion in the thicket;
\q he lies in wait to catch the oppressed.
\q He catches the oppressed when he pulls in his net.
\q
\v 10 His victims are crushed and beaten down;
\q they fall into his strong nets.

\s5
\q
\v 11 He says in his heart, "God has forgotten;
\q he covers his face; he will not bother to look."
\q
\v 12 Arise, Yahweh; lift up your hand in judgment, God.
\q  Do not forget the oppressed.

\s5
\q
\v 13 Why does the wicked man reject God
\q and say in his heart, "You will not hold me accountable"?
\q
\v 14 You have taken notice, for you always see the one who inflicts the misery and sorrow.
\q The helpless entrusts himself to you;
\q you rescue the fatherless.

\s5
\q
\v 15 Break the arm of the wicked and evil man;
\q make him accountable for his evil deeds, which he thought you would not discover.
\q
\v 16 Yahweh is King for ever and ever;
\q the nations are driven out of his land.

\s5
\q
\v 17 Yahweh, you have heard the needs of the oppressed;
\q you strengthen their heart, you listen to their prayer;
\q
\v 18 You defend the fatherless and the oppressed
\q so that no man on the earth will cause terror again.




\s5
\c 11
\d For the chief musician. A psalm of David.
\b
\q
\v 1 I take refuge in Yahweh; 
\q how will you say to me,
\q "Flee like a bird to the mountain"?
\q
\v 2 For see! The wicked prepare their bows.
\q They make ready their arrows on the strings
\q to shoot in the darkness at the upright in heart.

\s5
\q
\v 3 For if the foundations are ruined,
\q what can the righteous do?
\q
\v 4 Yahweh is in his holy temple;
\q his eyes watch, his eyes examine the children of men.

\s5
\q
\v 5 Yahweh examines both the righteous and the wicked,
\q but he hates those who love to do violence.
\q
\v 6 He rains burning coals and brimstone upon the wicked;
\q a scorching wind will be their portion from his cup!
\q
\v 7 For Yahweh is righteous, and he loves righteousness;
\q the upright will see his face.




\s5
\c 12
\d For the chief musician; set to the Sheminith. A psalm of David.
\b
\q
\v 1 Help, Yahweh, for the godly have disappeared;
\q the faithful have vanished.

\s5
\q
\v 2 Everyone says empty words to his neighbor;
\q everyone speaks with flattering lips and a double heart.
\q
\v 3 Yahweh, cut off all flattering lips,
\q every tongue declaring great things.
\q
\v 4 These are those who have said, "With our tongues will we prevail.
\q When our lips speak, who can be master over us?"

\s5
\q
\v 5 "Because of violence against the poor, because of the groans of the needy,
\q  I will arise," says Yahweh.
\q "I will provide the safety for which they long."

\s5
\q
\v 6 The words of Yahweh are pure words,
\q like silver purified in a furnace on the earth,
\q refined seven times.
\q
\v 7 You are Yahweh! You keep them.
\q You preserve the godly people from this wicked generation and forever.
\q
\v 8 The wicked walk on every side
\q when evil is exalted among the sons of men.




\s5
\c 13
\d For the chief musician. A psalm of David.
\b
\q
\v 1 How long, Yahweh will you keep forgetting about me?
\q How long will you hide your face from me?
\q
\v 2 How long must I worry
\q and have grief in my heart all day?
\q How long will my enemy triumph over me?

\s5
\q
\v 3  Look at me and answer me, Yahweh my God!
\q Enlighten my eyes, or I will sleep in death.
\q
\v 4 Do not let my enemy say, "I have defeated him,"
\q so that my enemy may not say, "I have prevailed over my adversary;" otherwise, my enemies will rejoice when I am brought down.

\s5
\q
\v 5 But I have trusted in your covenant faithfulness;
\q my heart rejoices in your salvation.
\q
\v 6 I will sing to Yahweh
\q because he has treated me very generously.


\s5
\c 14
\d For the chief musician. A psalm of David.
\b
\q
\v 1 A fool says in his heart, "There is no God."
\q They are corrupt and have done abominable iniquity;
\q there is no one who does good.

\s5
\q
\v 2 Yahweh looks down from heaven on the sons of mankind
\q to see if there are any who understand,
\q who seek after him.
\q
\v 3 Everyone has turned aside; all have become filthy;
\q there is no one who does good, no, not one.

\s5
\q
\v 4 Do they not know anything, those who commit iniquity,
\q those who eat up my people as they eat bread,
\q but who do not call on Yahweh?

\s5
\q
\v 5 They tremble with dread,
\q for God is with the righteous assembly!
\q
\v 6 You want to humiliate the poor person
\q even though Yahweh is his refuge.

\s5
\q
\v 7 Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come from Zion!
\q When Yahweh brings back his people from the captivity,
\q then Jacob will rejoice and Israel will be glad!



\s5
\c 15
\d A psalm of David.
\b
\q
\v 1 Yahweh, who may stay in your tabernacle?
\q Who may live on your holy hill?
\q
\v 2 He walks blamelessly and does what is right,
\q and speaks truth from his heart.

\s5
\q
\v 3 He does not slander with his tongue,
\q nor does harm to others,
\q nor insults his neighbor.

\s5
\q
\v 4 The worthless person is despised in his eyes,
\q but he honors those who fear Yahweh.
\q He swears to his own disadvantage and does not take back his promises.
\q
\v 5 He does not charge interest when he lends money.
\q He does not take bribes to testify against the innocent.
\q He who does these things will never be shaken.



\s5
\c 16
\d A michtam of David.
\b
\q
\v 1 Protect me, God, for I take refuge in you.
\q
\v 2 I say to Yahweh, "You are my Lord; my goodness is nothing apart from you.
\q
\v 3 As for the saints who are on the earth, they are noble people; all my delight is in them.

\s5
\q
\v 4 Their troubles will be increased, those who seek out other gods. I will not pour out drink offerings of blood to their gods
\q or lift up their names with my lips.

\s5
\q
\v 5 Yahweh, you are my chosen portion and my cup. You hold onto my destiny.
\q
\v 6 Measuring lines have been laid for me in pleasant places; surely a pleasing inheritance is mine.

\s5
\q
\v 7 I will bless Yahweh, who counsels me; even at night my mind instructs me.
\q
\v 8 I set Yahweh before me at all times, so I will not be shaken from his right hand!

\s5
\q
\v 9 Therefore my heart is glad; my honored heart exalts him; surely I will live in security.
\q
\v 10 For you will not abandon my soul to sheol. You will not let your faithful one see the pit.

\s5
\q
\v 11 You teach me the path of life; abundant  joy resides in your presence; delights abide in your right hand forever!"



\s5
\c 17
\d A prayer of David.
\b
\q
\v 1 Listen to my plea for justice, Yahweh; pay attention to my call for help!
\q Give ear to my prayer from lips without deceit.
\q
\v 2 Let my vindication come from your presence; let your eyes see what is right!

\s5
\q
\v 3 If you test my heart, if you come to me in the night,
\q you will purify me and will not find any evil plans; my mouth will not transgress.

\s5
\q
\v 4 As for the deeds of mankind, it is at the word of your lips that I have kept myself from the ways of the lawless.
\q
\v 5 My steps have held firmly to your tracks; my feet have not slipped.

\s5
\q
\v 6 I call to you, for you answer me, God; turn your ear to me and listen when I speak.
\q
\v 7 Show your covenant faithfulness in a wonderful way, you who save by your right hand those who take refuge in you from their enemies!

\s5
\q
\v 8 Protect me like the apple of your eye; hide me under the shadow of your wings
\q
\v 9 from the presence of the wicked ones who assault me, my enemies who surround me.
\q
\v 10 They have no mercy on anyone; their mouths speak with pride.

\s5
\q
\v 11 They have surrounded my steps. They set their eyes to strike me to the ground.
\q
\v 12 They are like a lion eager for a victim, like a young lion crouching in hidden places.

\s5
\q
\v 13 Arise, Yahweh! Attack them! Throw them down on their faces! Rescue my life from the wicked by your sword!
\q
\v 14 Rescue me from men by your hand, Yahweh, from men of this world whose prosperity is in this life alone!
\q You will fill the bellies of your treasured ones with riches; they will have many children and will leave their wealth to their children.

\s5
\q
\v 15 As for me, I will see your face in righteousness; I will be satisfied, when I awake, with a sight of you.




\s5
\c 18
\d For the Chief Musician. A psalm of David, the servant of Yahweh, when he sang to Yahweh the words of this song on 
the day that Yahweh rescued him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul. He sang:
\b
\q
\v 1 I love you, Yahweh, my strength.

\s5
\q
\v 2 Yahweh is my rock, my fortress, the one who brings me to safety; he is my God, my rock; I take refuge in him.
\q He is my shield, the horn of my salvation, and my stronghold.
\q
\v 3 I will call on Yahweh who is worthy to be praised, and I will be saved from my enemies.

\s5
\q
\v 4 The cords of death surrounded me, and the rushing waters of worthlessness overwhelmed me.
\q
\v 5 The cords of sheol surrounded me; the snares of death trapped me.

\s5
\q
\v 6 In my distress I called to Yahweh; I called for help to my God. He heard my voice from his temple;
\q my call for help went into his presence; it went into his ears.

\s5
\q
\v 7 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of the mountains also trembled
\q and were shaken because God was angry.
\q
\v 8 Smoke went up from out of his nostrils, and blazing fire came of his mouth. Coals were ignited by it.
\q 

\s5
\q
\v 9 He opened the heavens and came down, and thick darkness was under his feet.
\q
\v 10 He rode on a cherub and flew; he glided on the wings of the wind.

\s5
\q
\v 11 He made darkness a tent around him, heavy rainclouds in the skies.
\q
\v 12 From the lightning before him, hailstones and coals of fire fell.

\s5
\q
\v 13 Yahweh thundered in the heavens! The Most High shouted and sent hailstones and lightning.
\q
\v 14 He shot his arrows and scattered his enemies; many lightning bolts dispersed them.

\s5
\q
\v 15 Then the water channels appeared; the foundations of the world were exposed at your battle cry, Yahweh—
\q at the blast of the breath of your nostrils.

\s5
\q
\v 16 He reached down from above; he took hold of me! He pulled me out of the surging water.
\q
\v 17 He rescued me from my strong enemy, from those who hated me, for they were too strong for me.

\s5
\q
\v 18 They came against me on the day of my distress but Yahweh was my support!
\q
\v 19 He set me free in a wide open place; he saved me because he was pleased with me.

\s5
\q
\v 20 Yahweh has rewarded me because of my righteousness; he has restored me because my hands were clean.
\q
\v 21 For I have kept the ways of Yahweh and have not wickedly turned away from my God.

\s5
\q
\v 22 For all his righteous decrees have been before me; as for his statutes, I have not turned away from them.
\q
\v 23 I have also been innocent before him, and I have kept myself from sin.
\q
\v 24 Therefore Yahweh has restored me because of my righteousness, because my hands were clean before his eyes.

\s5
\q
\v 25 To anyone who is faithful, you show yourself to be faithful;
\q2 to a man who is blameless, you show yourself to be blameless.
\q
\v 26 To anyone who is pure, you show yourself pure; but you are clever toward anyone who is twisted.

\s5
\q
\v 27 For you save afflicted people, but you bring down those with proud, uplifted eyes!
\q
\v 28 For you give light to my lamp; Yahweh my God lights up my darkness.
\q
\v 29 For by you I can run over a barricade; by my God I can leap over a wall.

\s5
\q
\v 30 As for God: his way is perfect. The word of Yahweh is pure!
\q He is a shield to everyone who takes refuge in him.
\q
\v 31 For who is God except Yahweh? Who is a rock except our God?
\q
\v 32 It is God who puts strength on me like a belt, who places the blameless person on his path.

\s5
\q
\v 33 He makes my feet swift like a deer and places me on the mountains!
\q
\v 34 He trains my hands for war and my arms to bend a bow of bronze.

\s5
\q
\v 35 You have given me the shield of your salvation. Your right hand has supported me, and your favor has made me great.
\q
\v 36 You have made a wide place for my feet beneath me so that my feet have not slipped.

\s5
\q
\v 37 I pursued my enemies and caught them; I did not turn back until they were destroyed.
\q
\v 38 I smashed them so that they were unable to rise; they have fallen under my feet.
\q
\v 39 For you put strength on me like a belt for battle; you put under me those who rise up against me.

\s5
\q
\v 40 You gave me the back of my enemies' necks; I annihilated those who hated me.
\q
\v 41 They called for help, but no one saved them; they called out to Yahweh, but he did not answer them.
\q
\v 42 I beat them into fine pieces like dust before the wind; I threw them out like mud in the streets.

\s5
\q
\v 43 You rescued me from the disputes of people. You have made me the head over nations. People that I have not known serve me.
\q
\v 44 As soon as they heard of me, they obeyed me; foreigners were forced to bow to me.
\q
\v 45 The foreigners came trembling out of their strongholds.

\s5
\q
\v 46 Yahweh lives; may my rock be praised. May the God of my salvation be exalted.
\q
\v 47 This is the God who executes vengeance for me, who subjugates nations under me.

\s5
\q
\v 48 I am set free from my enemies! Indeed, you lifted me above the ones who rose against me! You rescued me from violent men.
\q
\v 49 Therefore I will give thanks to you, Yahweh, among the nations; I will sing praises to your name!

\s5
\q
\v 50 God gives great victory to his king, and he shows his covenant loyalty to his anointed one, to David and to his descendants forever.

\s5
\q
\v 9 The fear of Yahweh is pure, enduring forever;
\q the righteous decrees of Yahweh are true and altogether right!
\q

\s5
\q
\v 11 Yes, by them your servant is warned;
\q in obeying them there is great reward.
\q
\v 12 Who can discern all his own errors?
\q Cleanse me from hidden faults.

\s5
\q
\v 13 Keep your servant also from arrogant sins;

\s5

\q
\v 4 Our ancestors trusted in you;

\q
\v 8 They say, "He trusts in Yahweh;
\q let Yahweh rescue him.
\q Let him rescue him, for he delights in him."

\s5
\q

\q my neighbors are appalled at my situation,
\q and those who know me are horrified.
\q Those who see me in the street run from me.

\s5
\q
\v 12 I am forgotten as a dead man whom no one thinks about.
\q I am like a broken pot.
\q
\v 13 For I have heard the whispering of many,
\q terrifying news from every side
\q as they plot together against me.
\q They plot to take away my life.

\s5
\q
\v 14 But I trust in you, Yahweh;
\q I say, "You are my God."
\q
\v 15 My destiny is in your hand.
\q Rescue me from the hands of my enemies and from those who pursue me.



\q
\v 16 Make your face shine on your servant;
\q save me in your covenant faithfulness.

\s5
\q
\v 17 Do  not let me be humiliated, Yahweh; for I call out to you!
\q May the wicked be humiliated! May they be silent in sheol.
\q
\v 18 May lying lips be silenced
\q that speak against the righteous defiantly
\q with arrogance and contempt.

\s5
\q
\v 19 How great is your goodness
\q that you have stored up for those who revere you,
\q that you perform for those who take refuge in you
\q before all humanity!
\q
\v 20 In the shelter of your presence, you hide them from the plots of men.
\q You hide them in a shelter from the violence of tongues.

\s5
\q
\v 21 Blessed be Yahweh,
\q for he showed me his marvelous covenant faithfulness when I was in a beseiged city.
\q
\v 22 Though I said in my haste,
\q "I am cut off from your eyes,"
\q yet you heard my plea for help
\q when I cried to you.

\s5
\q
\v 23 Oh, love Yahweh, all you faithful followers.
\q Yahweh protects the faithful,
\q but he pays back the arrogant in full.
\q
\v 24 Be strong and confident,
\q all you who trust in Yahweh for help.


\s5
\c 32
\d A psalm of David. A maschil.
\b
\q
\v 1 Blessed is the person whose transgression is forgiven,
\q whose sin is covered.
\q
\v 2 Blessed is the man to whom Yahweh reckons no guilt
\q and in whose spirit there is no deceit.

\s5
\q
\v 3 When I remained silent, my bones were wasting away
\q while I groaned all day long.
\q
\v 4 For day and night your hand was heavy upon me.
\q My strength withered as in summer drought.
\qs Selah\qs*

\s5
\q
\v 5 Then I acknowledged my sin to you,
\q and I no longer hid my iniquity.
\q I said, "I will confess my transgressions to Yahweh,"
\q and you forgave the guilt of my sin. 
\qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 6 Because of this, all who are godly should pray to you at a time of great distress.
\q Then when the surging waters overflow, they will not reach those people.

\s5
\q
\v 7 You are my hiding place; you will guard me from trouble.
\q You will surround me with the songs of victory. 
\qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 8 I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you should go.
\q I will instruct you with my eye upon you.

\s5
\q
\v 9 Do not be like a horse or like a mule, which have no understanding;
\q it is only with bridle and bit to control them
\q that they will go where you want them to.
\q
\v 10 The wicked have many sorrows,
\q but Yahweh's covenant faithfulness will surround the one who trusts in him.

\s5
\q
\v 11 Be glad in Yahweh, and rejoice, you righteous;
\q shout for joy, all you who are upright in heart.


\s5
\c 33
\p
\q
\v 1 Rejoice in Yahweh, you righteous;
\q praise is appropriate for the upright.
\q
\v 2 Give thanks to Yahweh with the harp;
\q sing praises to him with the harp of ten strings.
\q
\v 3 Sing to him a new song;
\q play skillfully and sing with joy.

\s5
\q
\v 4 For Yahweh's word is upright,
\q and everything he does is fair.
\q
\v 5 He loves righteousness and justice.
\q The earth is full of Yahweh's covenant faithfulness.
\q
\v 6 By the word of Yahweh the heavens were made,
\q and all the stars were made by the breath of his mouth.

\s5
\q
\v 7 He gathers the waters of the sea together like a heap;
\q he puts the oceans in storehouses.
\q
\v 8 Let the whole earth fear Yahweh;
\q let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.
\q
\v 9 For he spoke, and it was done;
\q he commanded, and it stood in place.


\s5
\q
\v 10 Yahweh frustrates the alliances of nations;
\q he overrules the plans of the peoples.
\q
\v 11 The plans of Yahweh stand forever,
\q the plans of his heart for all generations.
\q
\v 12 Blessed is the nation whose God is Yahweh,
\q the people whom he has chosen as his own inheritance.

\s5
\q
\v 13 Yahweh looks from heaven;
\q he sees all the people.
\q
\v 14 From the place where he lives, 
\q he looks down on all who live on the earth.
\q
\v 15 He who shapes the hearts of them all
\q observes all their deeds.

\s5
\q
\v 16 No king is saved by a vast army;
\q a warrior is not saved by his great strength.
\q
\v 17 A horse is false security for victory;
\q in spite of his great strength, he cannot rescue.

\s5
\q
\v 18 See, Yahweh's eye is on those who fear him,
\q on those who count on his covenant faithfulness
\q
\v 19 to deliver their lives from death
\q and to keep them alive in times of famine.

\s5
\q
\v 20 We wait for Yahweh;
\q he is our help and our shield.
\q
\v 21 Our hearts rejoice in him,
\q for we trust in his holy name.

\s5
\q
\v 22 Let your covenant faithfulness, Yahweh, be with us
\q as we put our hope in you.


\s5
\c 34
\d A Psalm of David; when he pretended to be insane before Abimelech, who drove him out.
\b
\q
\v 1 I will praise Yahweh at all times;
\q his praise will always be in my mouth.

\s5
\q
\v 2 I will praise Yahweh;
\q may the oppressed hear and rejoice.
\q
\v 3 Praise Yahweh with me;
\q let us lift up his name together.

\s5
\q
\v 4 I sought Yahweh, and he answered me,
\q and he gave me victory over all my fears.
\q
\v 5 Those who look to him are radiant,
\q and their faces are not ashamed.
\q
\v 6 This oppressed man cried, and Yahweh heard him
\q and saved him from all his troubles.

\s5
\q
\v 7 The angel of Yahweh camps around those who fear him,
\q and he rescues them.
\q
\v 8 Taste and see that Yahweh is good;
\q blessed is the man who takes refuge in him.
\q
\v 9 Fear Yahweh, you, his chosen people;
\q there is no lack for those who fear him.

\s5
\q
\v 10 The young lions sometimes lack food and suffer hunger;
\q but those who seek Yahweh will not lack anything good.
\q
\v 11 Come, children, listen to me;
\q I will teach you the fear of Yahweh.

\s5
\q
\v 12 What man desires life
\q and desires to live many days and have a good life?
\q
\v 13 Then keep from speaking evil,
\q and keep your lips from speaking lies.
\q
\v 14 Turn away from evil and do good;
\q seek peace and promote it.

\s5
\q
\v 15 The eyes of Yahweh are on the righteous,
\q and his ears are directed toward their cry.
\q
\v 16 Yahweh is against evildoers,
\q in order to wipe out their memory from the earth.
\q
\v 17 The righteous cry out, and Yahweh hears
\q and rescues them from all their troubles.

\s5
\q
\v 18 Yahweh is near the  brokenhearted,
\q and he saves those with a crushed spirit.
\q
\v 19 Many are the troubles of the righteous,
\q but Yahweh gives him victory over them all.
\q
\v 20 He protects all his bones;
\q not one of them will be broken.

\s5
\q
\v 21 Evil will kill the wicked;
\q those who hate the righteous will be condemned.
\q
\v 22 Yahweh redeems the souls of his servants;
\q none of those who take refuge in him will be condemned.


\s5
\c 35
\d A psalm of David.
\b
\q
\v 1 Yahweh, work against those who work against me;
\q fight against those who fight against me.
\q
\v 2 Grab your small shield and large shield;
\q rise up and help me.
\q
\v 3 Use your spear and battle axe against those who chase me;
\q say to my soul, "I am your salvation."

\s5
\q
\v 4 May those who seek my life be shamed and dishonored.
\q May those who plan to harm me be turned back and confounded.
\q
\v 5 May they be as chaff before the wind,
\q as the angel of Yahweh drives them away.
\q
\v 6 May their way be dark and slippery,
\q as the angel of Yahweh chases them.

\s5
\q
\v 7 Without cause they set their net for me;
\q without cause they dug a pit for my life.
\q
\v 8 Let destruction overtake them by surprise.
\q Let the net that they have set catch them.
\q Let them fall into it, to their destruction.

\s5
\q
\v 9 But I will be joyful in Yahweh
\q and rejoice in his salvation.
\q
\v 10 With all my strength I will say, "Yahweh, who is like you,
\q who rescues the oppressed  from those who are too strong for them
\q  and the poor and needy from those who try to rob them?"

\s5
\q
\v 11 Unrighteous witnesses rise up;
\q they accuse me falsely.
\q
\v 12 They repay me evil for good.
\q I am sorrowful.

\s5
\q
\v 13 But, when they were sick, I wore sackcloth;
\q I fasted for them
\q with my head bowed on my chest.
\q
\v 14 I went about in grief as for my brother; 
\q I bent down in mourning as for my mother.

\s5
\q
\v 15 But when I stumbled, they rejoiced and gathered together;
\q they  gathered together against me, and I was surprised by them.
\q They tore at me without stopping.
\q
\v 16 With no respect at all they mocked me;
\q they gnashed at me with their teeth.

\s5
\q
\v 17 Lord, how long will you look on?
\q Rescue my soul from their destructive attacks,
\q my life from the lions.
\q
\v 18 Then I will thank you in the great assembly;
\q I will praise you among many people.

\s5
\q
\v 19 Do not let my deceitful enemies rejoice over me;
\q do not let them carry out their wicked schemes.
\q
\v 20 For they do not speak peace,
\q but they devise deceitful words against those  in our land who live in peace.

\s5
\q
\v 21 They open their mouths wide against me;
\q they said, "Ha, ha, our eyes have seen it."
\q
\v 22 You have seen it, Yahweh, do not be silent;
\q Lord, do not be far from me.
\q
\v 23 Arouse yourself and awake to my defense;
\q My God and my Lord, defend my cause.

\s5
\q
\v 24 Defend  me, Yahweh my God, because of your righteousness;
\q do not let them rejoice over me.
\q
\v 25 Do not let them say in their heart, "Aha, we have what we wanted."
\q Do not let them say, "We have devoured him."
\q
\v 26 Put them to shame and confound those who want to harm me.
\q May those who taunt me be covered with shame and dishonor.

\s5
\q
\v 27 Let those who desire my vindication shout for joy and be glad;
\q may they say continually, "Yahweh be praised,
\q he who delights in the welfare of his servant."
\q
\v 28 Then I will tell of your justice
\q and praise you all day long.


\s5
\c 36
\d For the chief musician. A psalm of David the servant of Yahweh.
\b
\q
\v 1 Sin speaks like an oracle in the heart of the wicked man; 
\q there is no fear of God in his eyes.
\q
\v 2 For he comforts himself,
\q thinking that his sin will not be discovered and be hated.

\s5
\q
\v 3 His words are sinful and deceitful;
\q he does not want to be wise and do good.
\q
\v 4 While he lies in bed, he plans ways to sin;
\q he sets out on an evil way;
\q he does not reject evil.
\b

\s5
\q
\v 5 Your covenant faithfulness, Yahweh, reaches to the heavens;
\q your loyalty reaches to the clouds.
\q
\v 6 Your justice is like the highest mountains;
\q your justice is like the deepest sea.
\q Yahweh, you preserve both mankind and the animals.

\s5
\q
\v 7 How precious is your covenant faithfulness, God!
\q Humanity takes refuge under the shadow of your wings.
\q
\v 8 They will be abundantly satisfied with the richness of the food of your house;
\q you will let them drink from the river of your precious blessings.
\q
\v 9 For with you is the fountain of life;
\q in your light we will see light.

\s5
\q
\v 10 Extend your covenant faithfulness fully to those who know you,
\q your defense to the upright of heart.
\q
\v 11 Do not let the foot of the arrogant man come near to me. 
\q Do not let the hand of the wicked drive me away.
\q
\v 12 Over there the evildoers have fallen;
\q they are knocked down and are not be able to get up.


\s5
\c 37
\d A psalm of David.
\b
\q
\v 1 Do not be irritated because of evildoers;
\q do not be envious of those  who act  unrighteously.
\q
\v 2 For they will soon dry up as the grass
\q and wither as the green plants.

\s5
\q
\v 3 Trust in Yahweh and do what is right;
\q settle in the land and make faithfulness your business.
\q
\v 4 Then delight yourself in Yahweh,
\q and he will give you the desires of your heart.

\s5
\q
\v 5 Give your ways to Yahweh;
\q trust in him, and he will act on your behalf.
\q
\v 6 He will display your justice like the daylight
\q and your innocence like the day at noon.

\s5
\q
\v 7 Be still before Yahweh and wait patiently for him.
\q Do  not be worry if someone makes his evil ways succeed, 
\q if a man makes evil plots.

\s5
\q
\v 8 Do not be  angry and frustrated.
\q Do not worry; this only makes trouble.
\q
\v 9 Evildoers will be cut off,
\q but those who wait for Yahweh will inherit the land.
\q
\v 10 In a little while the evil man will disappear;
\q  you will look at his place, but he will be gone.

\s5
\q
\v 11 But the meek will inherit the land
\q and will delight in great prosperity.
\q
\v 12 The wicked man plots against the righteous
\q and gnashes his teeth against him.
\q
\v 13 The Lord laughs at him,
\q for he sees that his day is coming.

\s5
\q
\v 14 The wicked have drawn out their swords and have bent their bows
\q to cast down the oppressed and needy,
\q to kill those who are upright.
\q
\v 15 Their swords will pierce their own hearts,
\q and their bows will be broken.

\s5
\q
\v 16 Better is the little that the righteous has
\q than the abundance of many wicked people.
\q
\v 17 For the arms of the wicked people will be broken,
\q but Yahweh supports the righteous people.

\s5
\q
\v 18 Yahweh watches over the blameless day by day,
\q and their heritage will be forever.
\q
\v 19 They will not be ashamed when times are bad.
\q When famine comes, they will have enough to eat.

\s5
\q
\v 20 But evil men will perish.
\q Yahweh's enemies will be like the glory of the pastures;
\q they will be  consumed and disappear in the smoke.
\q
\v 21 The wicked person borrows but does not repay,
\q but the righteous person is generous and gives.

\s5
\q
\v 22 Those who are blessed by God will inherit the land;
\q those who are cursed by him will be cut off.
\q
\v 23 It is by Yahweh that a man's steps are established,
\q the  man whose way is commendable in God's sight.
\q
\v 24 Though he stumbles, he will not fall down,
\q for Yahweh is holding him with his hand.

\s5
\q
\v 25 I was young and now am old;
\q I have never seen the righteous person abandoned
\q or his children begging for bread.
\q
\v 26 All the day long he is gracious and lends,
\q and his children become a blessing.
\q
\v 27 Turn away from evil and do what is right;
\q  then you will be safe forever.

\s5
\q
\v 28 For Yahweh loves justice
\q and does not abandon his faithful followers.
\q They are preserved forever,
\q but the descendants of the wicked will be cut off.
\q
\v 29 The righteous will inherit the land
\q and live there forever.
\q
\v 30 The mouth of the righteous person speaks wisdom
\q and increases justice.

\s5
\q
\v 31 The law of his God is in his heart;
\q his feet will not slip.
\q
\v 32 The wicked person watches the righteous person
\q and seeks to kill him.
\q
\v 33 Yahweh will not abandon him into the evil person's hand
\q or condemn him when he is judged.

\s5
\q
\v 34 Wait for Yahweh and keep his way,
\q and he will raise you up  to possess the land.
\q You will see when the wicked are cut off.

\s5
\q
\v 35 I have seen the wicked and terrifying person
\q  spread out like a green tree in its native soil.
\q
\v 36 But when I passed by again, he was not there.
\q  I looked for him, but he could not be found.

\s5
\q
\v 37 Observe the man of integrity, and mark the upright;
\q there is a good future for a man of peace.
\q
\v 38 Sinners will be totally destroyed;
\q the future for the wicked man is cut off.

\s5
\q
\v 39 Salvation of the righteous comes from Yahweh;
\q he protects them in the times of trouble.
\q
\v 40 Yahweh helps them and rescues them.
\q He rescues them from evil men and saves them
\q because they have taken refuge in him.

\c 38
\d A psalm of David, to bring to remembrance.
\b
\q
\v 1 Yahweh, do not rebuke me in your anger;
\q do not punish me in your wrath.
\q
\v 2 For your arrows pierce me,
\q and your hand presses me down.

\s5
\q
\v 3 My whole body is sick because of your anger;
\q there is no health in my bones because of my sin.
\q
\v 4 For my iniquities overwhelm me;
\q they are a burden too heavy for me.

\s5
\q
\v 5 My wounds are infected and smell
\q because of my foolish sins.
\q
\v 6 I am stooped over and humiliated every day;
\q I go about mourning all day long.

\s5
\q
\v 7 For I am overcome with shame,
\q and my whole body is sick.
\q
\v 8 I am numb and utterly crushed;
\q I groan because of the anguish of my heart.

\s5
\q
\v 9 Lord, you understand my heart's deepest yearnings,
\q and my groanings are not hidden from you.
\q
\v 10 My heart pounds, my strength fades,
\q and my eyesight dims.

\s5
\q
\v 11 My friends and companions shun me because of my condition;
\q my neighbors stand far off.
\q
\v 12 Those who seek my life lay snares for me.
\q They who seek my harm speak destructive words
\q and say deceitful words all day long.

\s5
\q
\v 13 But I, I am like a deaf man and hear nothing;
\q I am like a mute man who says nothing.
\q
\v 14 I am like a man who does not hear
\q and who has no reply.

\s5
\q
\v 15 Surely I wait for you, Yahweh;
\q you will answer, Lord my God.
\q
\v 16 I say this so that my enemies will not gloat over me.
\q If my foot slips, they will do terrible things to me.

\s5
\q
\v 17 For I am about to stumble,

\q
\v 18 I confess my guilt;
\q I am concerned about my sin.

\s5
\q
\v 19 But my enemies are numerous;
\q those who hate me wrongfully are many.
\q
\v 20 They repay me evil for good;

\s5
\q

\q Then finally I spoke.

\s5
\q
\v 4 "Yahweh, make me know when will be the end of my life

\q You are my only hope.

\s5
\q
\v 8 Give me victory over all my sins:
\q do not make me the object of insults by fools.

\s5
\q

\q
\v 2 He also brought me up out of a horrible pit, out of the miry clay,
\q and he set my feet on a rock and established my going.
 
\s5
\q
\v 3 He has put a new song in my mouth, praise to our God.
\q Many will see it and honor him
\q and will trust in Yahweh.
\q
\v 4 Blessed is the man who makes Yahweh his trust

\q
\s5
\q
\v 5 Many, Yahweh my God, are the wonderful deeds that you have done,
\q and your thoughts which are about us
\q cannot be numbered;

\q they would be more than could be counted.
\q
\v 6 You have no delight in sacrifice or offering,
\q but you have opened my ears;
\q you have not required burnt offerings or sin offerings.
 
\s5
\q
\v 7 Then said I, "See, I have come;
\q it is written about me in the scroll of the document.
\q
\v 8 I delight to do your will, my God;

\q
\v 9 I have proclaimed good news of your righteousness in the great assembly;
\q Yahweh, you know that my lips have not kept back from doing this.

\q
\v 11 Do not keep back your acts of mercy from me, Yahweh;
\q let your covenant faithfulness and your trustworthiness always preserve me.

\q you will make his bed of sickness into a bed of healing.

\s5
\q
\v 4 I said, "Yahweh, have mercy on me!
\q Heal me, for I have sinned against you."
\q
\v 5 My enemies speak evil against me, saying,
\q 'When will he die and his name perish?'
\q
\v 6 If my enemy comes to see me, he says worthless things;
\q his heart gathers up my disaster for itself;
\q when he goes away from me, he tells others about it.

\s5
\q
\v 7 All who hate me whisper together against me;
\q against me they hope for my hurt.

\v 8 "An evil disease," they say, "holds on tightly to him;

\q
\v 9 Indeed, even my own close friend, in whom I trusted,

\s5
\q
\v 10 But you, Yahweh, have mercy on me and raise me up
\q so that I may pay them back.

\d For the chief musician. A maschil of the sons of Korah.
\b
\q
\v 1 As the deer pants after streams of water,
\q so I thirst for you, God.
\q
\v 2 I thirst for God, for the living God;
\q when will I come and appear before God?
 
\s5
\q
\v 3 My tears have been my food day and night,
\q while my enemies are always saying to me, “Where is your God?”
\q
\v 4 These things I call to mind as I pour out my soul:
\q how I went with the throng and led them to the house of God
\q with the voice of joy and praise, a multitude celebrating a festival.
 
\s5
\q
\v 5 Why are you bowed down, my soul,
\q and why are you worried within me?
\q Hope in God, for I will yet praise him
\q for the help of his presence.
\b
\q
\v 6 My God, my soul is bowed down within me,
\q therefore I call you to mind from the land of the Jordan,
\q from the three peaks of Mount Hermon, and from the hill of Mizar.
 
\s5
\q
\v 7 Deep calls to deep at the noise of your waterfalls;
\q all your waves and your billows have gone over me.
\q
\v 8 Yet Yahweh will command his covenant faithfulness in the daytime;
\q in the night his song will be with me,
\q a prayer to the God of my life.
 
\s5
\q
\v 9 I will say to God, my rock, “Why have you forgotten me?
\q Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?”
\q
\v 10 As with a sword in my bones, my adversaries rebuke me,
\q while they always say to me, “Where is your God?”
 
\s5
\q
\v 11 Why are you bowed down, my soul?
\q Why are you worried within me?
\q Hope in God, for I will yet praise him,
\q who is the help of my face and my God.




\s5
\c 43
\p
\q
\v 1 Judge me, God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation;
\q
\v 2 For you are the God of my strength; why have you thrown me away?
\q Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
 
\s5
\q
\v 3 Oh, send out your light and your truth; let them lead me;
\q let them bring me to your holy hill
\q and to your tabernacles.
\q
\v 4 Then I will go to the altar of God,
\q to God my exceeding joy;
\q and on the harp will I praise you, God, my God.
 
\s5
\q
\v 5 Why are you bowed down, my soul?
\q Why are you disquieted within me?
\q HJpe in God; for I will yet praise him,
\q who is my help and my God.

\c 44
\d For the chief musician. A psalm of the sons of Korah. A maschil.
\b
\q
\v 1 We have heard with our ears, God,
\q our fathers have told us
\q what work you did in their days,
\q in the days of old.
\q
\v 2 You drove out the nations with your hand,
\q but you planted our people;
\q you afflicted the peoples,
\q but you spread our people out in the land.
 
\s5
\q
\v 3 For they did not obtain the land for their possession by their own sword,
\q neither did their own arm save them;
\q but your right hand, your arm, and the light of your face,
\q because you were favorable to them.
\q
\v 4 God, You are my King;
\q command victory for Jacob.
 
\s5
\q
\v 5 Through you we will push down our adversaries;
\q through your name we will tread them under, those who rise up against us.
\q
\v 6 For I will not trust in my bow,
\q neither will my sword save me.
 
\s5
\q
\v 7 But you have saved us from our adversaries,
\q and have put to shame those who hate us.
\q
\v 8 In God we have made our boast all the day long,
\q and we will give thanks to your name forever. 
\qs Selah\qs*
\b
 
\s5
\q
\v 9 But now you have thrown us off and brought us dishonor,
\q and you do not go out with our armies.
\q
\v 10 You make us turn back from the adversary;
\q and those who hate us take spoil for themselves.
\q
\v 11 You have made us like sheep destined for food
\q and have scattered us among the nations.
 
\s5
\q
\v 12 You sell your people for nothing;
\q you have not increased your wealth by doing so.
\q
\v 13 You make us a rebuke to our neighbors,
\q a scoffing and a derision to those who are around us.
\q
\v 14 You make us an insult among the nations,
\q a shaking of the head among the peoples.
 
\s5
\q
\v 15 All the day long my dishonor is before me,
\q and the shame of my face has covered me
\q
\v 16 because of the voice of him who rebukes and insults,
\q because of the enemy and the avenger.
\q
\v 17 All this has come on us; yet we have not forgotten you
\q or dealt falsely with your covenant.
 
\s5
\q
\v 18 Our heart has not turned back;
\q our steps have not gone from your way.
\q
\v 19 Yet you have severely broken us in the place of jackals
\q and covered us with the shadow of death.
\q
\v 20 If we have forgotten the name of our God
\q or spread out our hands to a strange god,
\q
\v 21 would not God search this out?
\q For he knows the secrets of the heart.
\q
\v 22 Indeed, for your sake we are being killed all day long;
\q we are considered to be sheep for the slaughter.
 
\s5
\q
\v 23 Awake, why do you sleep, Lord?
\q Arise, do not throw us off permanently.
\q
\v 24 Why do you hide your face
\q and forget our affliction and our oppression?
 
\s5
\q
\v 25 For we have melted away into the dust;
\q our bodies cling to the earth.
\q
\v 26 Rise up for our help
\q and redeem us for the sake of your covenant faithfulness.

\q
\v 1 My heart overflows on a good subject;
\q I will read aloud the words I have composed about the king;

\s5
\q
\v 3 Put your sword on your thigh, mighty one,

\v 4 In your majesty ride on triumphantly
\q because of trustworthiness, meekness, and righteousness;

\s5
\q
\v 5 Your arrows are sharp;
\q the peoples fall under you;
\q your arrows are in the hearts of the king’s enemies.
\q
\v 6 Your throne, God, is forever and ever;
\q a scepter of justice is the scepter of your kingdom.
\q
\v 7 You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness;
\q therefore God, your God, has anointed you
\q with the oil of gladness more than your companions.
 
\s5
\q
\v 8 All your garments smell of myrrh, aloes, and
cassia;
\q out of ivory palaces stringed instruments have made you glad.
\q
\v 9 Kings’ daughters are among your honorable women;
\q at your right hand stands the queen clothed in gold of Ophir.
 
\s5
\q
\v 10 Listen, daughter, consider and incline your ear;
\q forget your own people and your father’s house.
\q
\v 11 In this way the king will desire your beauty;
\q he is your master; revere him.
 
\s5
\q
\v 12 The daughter of Tyre will be there with a gift;
\q the rich among the people will beg for your favor.
\q
\v 13 The royal daughter in the palace is all glorious;
\q her clothing is worked with gold.
 
\s5
\q
\v 14 She will be led to the king in embroidered dress;
\q the virgins, her companions who follow her,
\q will be brought to you.
\q
\v 15 They will be led by gladness and rejoicing;
\q they will enter into the king’s palace.
 
\s5
\q
\v 16 In the place of your fathers will be your children,

\q
\v 17 I will make your name to be remembered in all generations;

\q
\v 1 Great is Yahweh and greatly to be praised,

\q
\v 2 Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth,
\q is Mount Zion, on the sides of the north,

\q
\v 3 God has made himself known in her palaces as a refuge.

\v 2 Both low and high,
\q rich and poor together.
 
\s5
\q
\v 3 My mouth will speak wisdom
\q and the meditation of my heart will be of understanding.
\q
\v 4 I will incline my ear to a parable;
\q I will begin my parable with the harp.

\v 5 Why should I fear the days of evil,
\q when iniquity surrounds me at my heels?
 
\s5
\q
\v 6 Those who trust in their wealth
\q and boast about the amount of their riches—
\q
\v 7 It is certain that no one can redeem his brother
\q or give God a ransom for him,
\q
\v 8 For the redemption of one’s life is costly,
\q and no one can pay what we owe.
 
\s5
\q
\v 9 No one can live forever
\q so that his body should not decay.
\q
\v 10 For he will see decay. Wise men die;
\q the fool and the brute alike perish
\q and leave their wealth to others.
 
\s5
\q
\v 11 Their inner thought is that their families will
continue forever,
\q and the places where they live, to all generations;
\q they call their lands after their own names.
 
\s5
\q
\v 12 But man, having wealth, does not remain alive;
\q he is like the beasts that perish.
\b
\q
\v 13 This, their way, is their folly;
\q yet after them, men approve of their sayings. 
\qs Selah\qs*
 
\s5
\q
\v 14 They are appointed like a flock to go to sheol;
\q death will be their shepherd;

\q and there be no place for them to live.
\q
\v 15 But God will redeem my life from the power of sheol;
\q he will receive me. 
\qs Selah\qs*
 
\s5
\q
\v 16 Do not be afraid when one becomes rich,

\q his power will not descend with him.
 
\s5
\q
\v 18 He blessed his soul while he lived—
\q and men praise you when you live for yourself—
\q
\v 19 he will go to the generation of his fathers

\q
\v 2 Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty,
\q God has shone.
 
\s5
\q
\v 3 Our God comes and does not stay silent;
\q a fire devours before him,
\q and it is very stormy around him.
\q
\v 4 He calls to the heavens above
\q and to the earth so that he may judge his people:
\q
\v 5 "Gather my faithful ones together to me,
\q those who have made a covenant with me by sacrifice."
 
\s5
\q

\q
\v 8 I will not reprove you for your sacrifices;
\q your burnt offerings are always before me.
 
\s5
\q
\v 9 I will take no bull out of your house,
\q or male goats out of your folds.

\v 10 For every beast of the forest is mine,

\q and throw my words away?
 
\s5
\q
\v 18 When you see a thief, you agree with him;
\q you participate with those who commit adultery.
\q
\v 19 You give your mouth to evil,
\q and your tongue expresses deceit.
\q
\v 20 You sit and speak against your brother;
\q you slander your own mother’s son.
 
\s5
\q
\v 21 You have done these things, but I have kept silent,
\q so you thought that I was someone just like yourself.
\q But I will reprove you and bring up, right before your eyes, all the things you have done.
\b
\q
\v 22 Now consider this, you who forget God;
\q otherwise I will tear you in pieces, and there will be no one to come to help you:

\q
\v 1 Have mercy on me, God, because of your covenant faithfulness;

\q
\v 2 Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity

\s5
\q
\v 3 For I know my transgressions,

\q and done what is evil in your sight;
\q you are right when you speak;
\q you are correct when you judge.
 
\s5
\q
\v 5 See, I was born in iniquity;
\q as soon as my mother conceived me, I was in sin.
\q
\v 6 See, you desire trustworthiness in my heart;
\q in my heart you will make me know wisdom.
 
\s5
\q
\v 7 Purify me with hyssop, and I will be clean;

\q
\v 8 Make me hear joy and gladness
\q so that the bones that you have broken may rejoice.

\v 9 Hide your face from my sins

\s5
\q
\v 12 Restore to me the joy of your salvation,

\q
\v 13 Then will I teach transgressors your ways,
\q and sinners will be converted to you.

\q
\v 14 Forgive me for shedding blood, God of my salvation,
\q and I will shout for the joy of your righteousness.
\q
\v 15 Lord, open my lips,

\q
\v 16 For you do not delight in sacrifice, or I would give it;
\q you have no pleasure in burnt offerings.

\q
\v 17 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit;
\q you will not despise a broken and a contrite heart, God.
\b
\q
\v 18 Do good in your good pleasure to Zion;

\d For the chief musician; on stringed instruments. A maschil of David.
\b
\q
\v 1 Give ear to my prayer, God;
\q and do not hide yourself from my plea.
\q
\v 2 Pay attention to me and answer me;
\q I have no rest in my troubles 
\q
\v 3 because of the voice of my enemies,
\q because of the oppression of the wicked;
\q for they bring trouble on me
\q and persecute me in anger.
 
\s5
\q
\v 4 My heart is very pained in me,
\q and the terrors of death have fallen on me.
\q
\v 5 Fearfulness and trembling have come on me,
\q and horror has overwhelmed me.
 
\s5
\q
\v 6 I said, “Oh, if only I had wings like a dove!
\q Then would I fly away and be at rest.
\q
\v 7 See, then I would wander far away;
\q I would stay in the wilderness. 
\qs Selah\qs*
 
\s5
\q
\v 8 I would hurry to a shelter
\q from the stormy wind and tempest."
\q
\v 9 Destroy them, Lord, and confuse their languages,
\q for I have seen violence and strife in the city.
 
\s5
\q
\v 10 Day and night they go about on her walls;
\q iniquity and mischief are in the middle of her.
\q
\v 11 Wickedness is in the middle of it;
\q oppression and deceit do not leave its streets.
 
\s5
\q
\v 12 For it was not an enemy who rebuked me,
\q then I could have borne it;
\q neither was it he who hated me who raised himself up against me,
\q then I would have hidden myself from him.
\q
\v 13 But it was you, a man equal to myself,
\q my companion and my close friend.
\q
\v 14 We had sweet fellowship together;
\q we walked in the house of God with the throng.
 
\s5
\q
\v 15 Let death come suddenly on them;
\q let them go down alive to sheol,
\q for wickedness is where they live, right among them.
 
\s5
\q
\v 16 As for me, I will call on God,
\q and Yahweh will save me.
\q
\v 17 In the evening, morning and at noonday I complain and moan;
\q he will hear my voice.
\q
\v 18 He will safely rescue my life from the battle that was against me,
\q for those who fought against me were many.
 
\s5
\q
\v 19 God, he who remains from ancient times, 
\q will hear and respond to them.
 \qs Selah\qs*
\q Those men do not change;
\q they do not fear God.
 
\s5
\q
\v 20 My friend has raised his hands against those who were at peace with him;
\q he has profaned the covenant that he had.
\q
\v 21 His mouth was smooth as butter,
\q but his heart was hostile;
\q his words were softer than oil,
\q yet they were actually drawn swords.
 
\s5
\q
\v 22 Place your burdens on Yahweh, and he will sustain you;
\q he will never allow a righteous person to totter.
\q
\v 23 But you, God, will bring the wicked down into the pit of destruction;
\q bloodthirsty and deceitful men will not live even half as long as others,
\q but I will trust in you.

\b
\q
\v 1 Be merciful to me, God, for someone wishes to swallow me up;

\q
\v 2 My enemies wish to swallow me up all the day long;

\s5
\q
\v 3 When I am afraid,

\s5
\q
\v 5 All the day long they twist my words;
\q all their thoughts are against me for evil.
\q
\v 6 They gather themselves together, they hide themselves,
\q and they mark my steps,
\q just as they have waited for my life.
 
\s5
\q
\v 7 Do not let them escape doing iniquity.
\q Bring down the peoples in your anger, God.
\q
\v 8 You number my wanderings
\q and put my tears into your bottle;
\q are they not in your book?
 
\s5
\q
\v 9 Then my enemies will turn back on the day that I call to you;
\q this I know, that God is for me.
\q
\v 10 In God, whose word I praise—
\q in Yahweh, whose word I praise—
\q
\v 11 In God I have put my trust; I will not be afraid;
\q what can mere man do to me?

\s5
\q
\v 12 The duty to fulfill my vows to you is on me, God;
\q I will give thank offerings to you.
\q
\v 13 For you have rescued my life from death;
\q you have kept my feet from falling,
\q so that I may walk before God
\q in the light of the living.

\q I stay under your wings for protection until this destruction is over.
 
\s5
\q
\v 2 I will cry to God Most High,
\q to God, who does all things for me.
\q
\v 3 He will send help from heaven and save me,
\q when the man who wishes to swallow me up rebukes me;
\qs Selah\qs*
\q God will send out to me his covenant faithfulness and his trustworthiness.
 
\s5
\q
\v 4 My life is among lions;
\q I am among those who are ready to devour me.
\q I am among people whose teeth are spears and arrows,
\q and whose tongues are sharp swords.
\q
\v 5 Be exalted, God, above the heavens;
\q let your glory be above all the earth.
\b
 
\s5
\q
\v 6 They spread out a net for my feet;
\q I was distressed. 
\q They dug a pit in front of me.
\q They themselves have fallen into the middle of it! 
\qs Selah\qs*
 
\s5
\q
\v 7 My heart is fixed, God, my heart is fixed;
\q I will sing, yes, I will sing praises.
\q
\v 8 Wake up, my honored heart; wake up, lute and harp;
\q I will wake up the dawn.
 
\s5
\q
\v 9 I will give thanks to you, Lord, among the peoples;

of David. A michtam.
\b
\q
\v 1 Do you rulers speak righteousness?
\q Do you judge uprightly, you people?
\q
\v 2 No, you commit wickedness in your heart;
\q you distribute violence throughout the land with your hands.
 
\s5
\q
\v 3 The wicked are estranged from the womb;
\q they go astray as soon as they are born, speaking lies.
\q
\v 4 Their poison is like a snake’s poison;
\q they are like a deaf adder that stops up its ears,
\q
\v 5 that pays no attention to the voice of charmers,
\q no matter how skillful they are.
 
\s5
\q
\v 6 Break their teeth in their mouths, God;
\q break out the great teeth of the young lions, Yahweh.
\q
\v 7 Let them melt away as water that runs off;
\q when they shoot their arrows, let them be as though they had no points.
\q
\v 8 Let them be like a snail that melts and passes away,
\q like the untimely-born child of a woman that never sees the sunlight.
 
\s5
\q
\v 9 Before your pots can feel the thorns burning heat,
\q he will take them away with a whirlwind, the green thorns and the burning thorns alike.
\q
\v 10 The righteous will rejoice when he sees God’s vengeance;
\q he will wash his feet in the blood of the wicked,
\q
\v 11 so that men will say, “Truly, there is a reward for the righteous person;
\q truly there is a God who judges the earth."

\b
\q
\v 1 Rescue me from my enemies, my God;

\q
\v 2 Keep me safe from the workers of iniquity,
\q and save me from the bloodthirsty men.
 
\s5
\q
\v 3 For, see, they wait in ambush to take my life.
\q The mighty evildoers gather themselves together against me,
\q but not because of my transgression or my sin, Yahweh.
\q
\v 4 They prepare to run at me although I am without fault;
\q awake and help me and see.
 
\s5
\q
\v 5 You, Yahweh God of hosts, the God of Israel,
\q arise and punish all the nations;
\q do not be merciful to any wicked transgressors. 
\qs Selah\qs*
 
\s5
\q
\v 6 They return at evening, they howl like dogs
\q and go around the city.
\q
\v 7 See, they belch out with their mouths;
\q swords are in their lips,
\q for they say, “Who hears us?”
 
\s5
\q
\v 8 But you, Yahweh, laugh at them;
\q you hold all the nations in derision.
\q
\v 9 God, my strength, I will pay attention to you;
\q you are my high tower.
 
\s5
\q
\v 10 My God will meet me with his covenant faithfulness;
\q God will let me see my desire on my enemies.
\q
\v 11 Do not kill them, or my people will forget.
\q Scatter them by your power and make them fall, Lord our shield.
 
\s5
\q
\v 12 For the sins of their mouths and the words of their lips,
\q let them be captured in their pride,
\q and for the curses and lies that they express.
\q
\v 13 Consume them in wrath, consume them so that they will be no more;
\q let them know that God rules in Jacob
\q and to the ends of the earth. 
\qs Selah\qs*
 
\s5
\q
\v 14 At evening let them return; let them howl like dogs
\q and go around the city.
\q
\v 15 They will wander up and down for food
\q and will wait all night if they are not satisfied.
 
\s5
\q
\v 16 But I will sing about your strength;
\q for you have been my high tower
\q and a refuge in the day of my distress.
\q
\v 17 To you, my strength, I will sing praises;

\b
\q
\v 1 God, you have cast us off; you have broken us down;
\q you have been angry; restore us again.
 
\s5
\q
\v 2 You have made the land tremble; you have torn it apart;
\q heal its breaches, for it is shaking.
\q
\v 3 You have shown your people severe things;
\q you have made us drink the wine of staggering.
 
\s5
\q
\v 4 You have given a banner to those who honor you
\q so that it may be displayed because of the truth. 
\qs Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 5 So that those you love may be rescued,
\q rescue us with your right hand and answer me.
 
\s5
\q
\v 6 God has spoken in his holiness, "I will rejoice;
\q I will divide Shechem and apportion out the valley of Succoth.
\q
\v 7 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine;
\q Ephraim also is my helmet;
\q Judah is my scepter.
 
\s5
\q
\v 8 Moab is my washbasin;
\q over Edom I will throw my shoe;
\q I will shout in triumph because of Philistia.
\q
\v 9 Who will bring me into the strong city?
\q Who will lead me to Edom?"
 
\s5
\q
\v 10 But you, God, have you not rejected us?
\q You do not go into battle with our army.
\q
\v 11 Give us help against the enemy,

\q
\v 2 From the ends of the earth will I call to you when my heart is overwhelmed;
\q lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
\q
\v 3 For you have been a refuge for me,
\q a strong tower from the enemy.
 
\s5
\q
\v 4 I will live in your tabernacle forever;
\q I will take refuge in the hiding place under your wings. 
\qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 5 For you, God, have heard my vows;
\q you have given me the inheritance you have for those who honor your name.
 
\s5
\q
\v 6 You will prolong the king’s life;
\q his years will be like many generations.
\q

\d For the chief musician; after the manner of Jeduthun. A Psalm of David.

\q
\v 1 I wait in silence for God alone;
\q my salvation comes from him.
\q
\v 2 He alone is my rock and my salvation;

\s5
\q
\v 3 How long, all of you, will you attack a man,
\q that you may tip him over
\q like a leaning wall or a shaky fence?
\q
\v 4 They consult with him only to bring him down from his honorable position;
\q they love to tell lies;
\q they bless him with their mouths, but in their hearts they curse him. 
\qs Selah\qs*
 
\s5
\q
\v 5 I wait in silence for God alone;

\v 8 Trust in him at all times, you people;
\q pour out your heart before him;
\q God is a refuge for us. 
\qs Selah\qs*
 
\s5
\q
\v 9 Surely men of low standing are vanity, and men of high standing are a lie;
\q they will weigh lightly in the scales;
\q weighed together, they are lighter than nothing.
\q
\v 10 Do not trust in oppression or robbery;
\q and do not hope uselessly in riches,
\q for they will bear no fruit; do not fix your heart on them.
 
\s5
\q
\v 11 God has spoken once,
\q twice have I heard this:
\q power belongs to God.
\q
\v 12 Also to you, Lord, belongs covenant faithfulness,
\q for you pay back every person for what he has done.
 




\s5
\c 63
\d A psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah.
\b
\q
\v 1 God, you are my God! I earnestly search for you,
\q my soul thirsts for you, and my flesh longs for you,
\q in a dry and weary land where there is no water.
\q
\v 2 So I have looked on you in the sanctuary
\q to see your power and your glory.
 
\s5
\q
\v 3 Because your covenant faithfulness is better than life,
\q my lips will praise you.
\q
\v 4 So I will bless you while I live;
\q I will lift up my hands in your name.
 
\s5
\q
\v 5 It will be as if ate a meal of  marrow and fatness;
\q with joyful lips my mouth will praise you.
\q
\v 6 when I think about you on my bed
\q and meditate on you in the night hours.
 
\s5
\q
\v 7 For you have been my help,
\q and in the shadow of your wings I rejoice.
\q
\v 8 I cling to you;
\q your right hand supports me.
 
\s5
\q
\v 9 But those who seek to destroy my life
\q will go down into the lowest parts of the earth.
\q
\v 10 They will be handed over to the power of the sword,
\q and they will become food for the jackals.
\q
\s5
\q
\v 11 But the king will rejoice in God;
\q everyone who swears by him will be proud of him,
\q but the mouth of those who speak lies will be stopped up.
 




\s5
\c 64
\d For the chief musician. A psalm of David.
\b
\q
\v 1 Hear my voice, God, listen to my complaint;
\q preserve my life from fear of my enemies.
\q
\v 2 Hide me from the secret plotting of evildoers,
\q from the commotion of the doers of iniquity.
 
\s5
\q
\v 3 They have sharpened their tongues like swords;
\q they have aimed their arrows, bitter words,
\q
\v 4 so that they may shoot from secret places at someone who is innocent;
\q suddenly they shoot at him and fear nothing.
 
\s5
\q
\v 5 They encourage themselves in an evil plan;
\q they consult privately together in order to set traps;
\q they say, “Who will see us?”
\q
\v 6 They invent sinful plans;
\q “We have finished,” they say, “a careful plan."
\q The inner thoughts and hearts of man are deep.
 
\s5
\q
\v 7 But God will shoot them;
\q suddenly they will be wounded with his arrows.
\q
\v 8 They will be made to stumble, since their own tongues are against them;
\q all who see them will wag their heads.
\q
\v 9 All people will fear
\q and will declare God’s deeds.
\q They will wisely think about what he has done.
 
\s5
\q
\v 10 The righteous will be glad about Yahweh and will take refuge in him;
\q all the upright in heart will take pride in him.

\s5
\q
\v 4 Blessed is the man whom you choose to bring near to you
\q so that he may live in your courts.
\q We will be satisfied with the goodness of your house,

\q God of our salvation;

\v 7 It is you who quiet the roaring of the seas,
\q the roaring of their waves,
\q and the commotion of the peoples.
 
\s5
\q
\v 8 Those who live in the uttermost parts of the earth are afraid of the evidence of your deeds;
\q you make the east and the west rejoice.
\q
\v 9 You come to help the earth; you water it;
\q you greatly enrich it;
\q the river of God is full of water;
\q you provide mankind grain when you have prepared the earth.
 
\s5
\q
\v 10 You water its furrows abundantly;
\q you settle down the furrows’ ridges;
\q you make them soft with rain showers;
\q you bless the sprouts between them.
\q
\v 11 You crown the year with your goodness;
\q the tracks behind your chariot drop fatness down to the earth.
\q
\v 12 It drops onto the pastures in the wilderness,
\q and the hills are dressed with a belt of joy.
 
\s5
\q
\v 13 The pastures are clothed with flocks;
\q the valleys also are covered over with grain;
\q they shout for joy, and they sing.

\qs Selah\qs*
 
\s5
\q
\v 5 Come and see the works of God;

\q
\v 6 He turned the sea into dry land;
\q they went through the river on foot;
\q there we rejoiced in him.
\q
\v 7 He rules forever by his might;
\q his eyes observe the nations;
\q let not the rebellious exalt themselves. 
\qs Selah\qs*
 
\s5
\q
\v 8 Give blessing to God, you people,

\s5
\q
\v 10 For you, God, have tested us;
\q you have tested us as silver is tested.
\q
\v 11 You brought us into a net;
\q you laid a severe burden on our waists.
\q
\v 12 You made people ride over our heads;
\q we went through fire and water,
\q but you brought us out into a spacious place.
 
\s5
\q
\v 13 I will come into your house with burnt offerings;
\q I will pay you my vows
\q
\v 14 which my lips promised
\q and my mouth spoke when I was in distress.
\q
\v 15 I will offer to you burnt offerings of fat animals
\q with the sweet aroma of rams;
\q I will offer bulls and goats. 
\qs Selah\qs*
 
\s5
\q
\v 16 Come and listen, all you who fear God,

\q

\q
\v 18 If I had seen sin within  my heart,

\q
\v 1 Let God arise; let his enemies be scattered;

\q
\v 2 As smoke is driven away, so drive them away;

\v 16 Why do you look in envy, you high hill country,
\q at the mountain which God desires for the place he will live?
\q Indeed, Yahweh will live in it forever.
 
\s5
\q
\v 17 The chariots of God are twenty thousand, thousands upon thousands;
\q the Lord is among them in the sanctuary, as at Sinai.
\q
\v 18 You have ascended on high; you have led away captives;
\q you have received gifts from among men,
\q even from those who fought against you,
\q so that you, Yahweh God, might live there.
\b
 
\s5
\q
\v 19 Blessed be the Lord, who daily bears our burdens,
\q the God who is our salvation. 
\qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 20 Our God is a God who saves;
\q Yahweh the Lord is the one who is able to rescue us from death.
\q
\v 21 But God will strike through the heads of his enemies,
\q through the hairy scalps of those who walk in offenses against him.
 
\s5
\q
\v 22 The Lord said, “I will bring my enemies back from Bashan;
\q I will bring them back from the depths of the sea
\q
\v 23 so that you may crush your enemies, dipping your foot in blood,
\q and so that the tongues of your dogs may have their share from your 
enemies.”
 
\s5
\q
\v 24 They have seen your processions, God,
\q the processions of my God, my King, into the sanctuary.
\q
\v 25 The singers went first, the minstrels followed after,
\q and in the middle were the unmarried girls playing small drums.
 
\s5
\q
\v 26 Bless God in the assembly;
\q praise Yahweh, you true descendants of Israel.
\q
\v 27 There is first Benjamin, the smallest tribe,
\q then the leaders of Judah and their multitudes,
\q the leaders of Zebulun and the leaders of Naphtali.
\b
 
\s5
\q
\v 28 Your God, Israel, has decreed your strength;
\q reveal to us your power, God, as you have revealed it in times past.

\q
\v 30 Shout in battle against the wild beasts in the reeds,
\q against the peoples, that multitude of bulls and calves.
\q Humiliate them and make them bring you gifts;
\q scatter the peoples who love to wage war.
\q
\v 31 Princes will come out of Egypt;
\q Ethiopia will hurry to reach out with her hands to God.

\q

\q Blessed be God.
 




\s5
\c 69
\d For the chief musician; set to Shoshannim. A psalm of David.
\b
\q
\v 1 Save me, God;
\q for the waters have put my life in danger.
\q
\v 2 I sink in deep mire, where there is no place to stand;
\q I have come into deep waters, where the floods flow over me.
 
\s5
\q
\v 3 I am weary with my crying; my throat is dry;
\q my eyes fail while I wait for my God.
\q
\v 4 Those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs on my head;
\q those who would cut me off, being my enemies for wrong reasons, are mighty;
\q what I did not steal, I have to give back.
 
\s5
\q
\v 5 God, you know my foolishness,
\q and my sins are not hidden from you.
\q
\v 6 Let not those who wait for you be put to shame because of me, Lord Yahweh of hosts;
\q let not those who seek you be brought to dishonor because of me, God of Israel.
 
\s5
\q
\v 7 For your sake I have borne rebuke;
\q shame has covered my face.
\q
\v 8 I have become a stranger to my brothers,
\q an alien to my mother’s children.
\q
\v 9 For the zeal of your house has eaten me up,
\q and the rebukes of those who rebuke you have fallen on me.
 
\s5
\q
\v 10 When I wept and did not eat food,
\q they insulted me.
\q
\v 11 When I made sackcloth my clothing,
\q I became the object of a proverb to them.
\q
\v 12 Those who sit in the city gate talk about me;
\q I am a song of drunkards.
 
\s5
\q
\v 13 But as for me, my prayer is to you, Yahweh, at a time that you will accept;
\q answer me in the trustworthiness of your salvation.
\q
\v 14 Pull me out of the mire, and do not let me sink;
\q let me be taken away from those who hate me and rescued out of the deep waters.
\q
\v 15 Do not let the floods of water overwhelm me,
\q neither let the deep swallow me up.
\q Do not let the pit shut its mouth on me.
 
\s5
\q
\v 16 Answer me, Yahweh, for your covenant faithfulness is good;
\q because your mercies for me are many, turn to me.
\q
\v 17 Do not hide your face from your servant,
\q for I am in distress; answer me quickly.
 
\s5
\q
\v 18 Draw near to me and redeem me.
\q Because of my enemies, ransom me.
\q
\v 19 You know my rebuke, my shame, and my dishonor;
\q my adversaries are all before you.
 
\s5
\q
\v 20 Rebuke has broken my heart; I am full of heaviness;
\q I looked for someone to take pity, but there was none;
\q I looked for comforters, but I found none.
\q
\v 21 They gave me poison for my food;
\q in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
 
\s5
\q
\v 22 Let their table before them become a snare;
\q when they think they are in safety, let it become a trap.
\q
\v 23 Let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see;
\q and always make their loins shake.
 
\s5
\q
\v 24 Pour out your indignation on them,
\q and let the fierceness of your anger overtake them.
\q
\v 25 Let their place be a desolation;
\q let no one live in their tents.
 
\s5
\q
\v 26 For they persecute him whom you have smitten;
\q they report to others about the pain of those whom you have wounded.
\q
\v 27 Accuse them of having committed iniquity after iniquity;
\q do not let them come into your righteous victory.
 
\s5
\q
\v 28 Let them be blotted out of the book of life
\q and not be written down along with the righteous.
\q
\v 29 But I am poor and sorrowful;
\q let your salvation, God, set me up on high.
 
\s5
\q
\v 30 I will praise the name of God with a song
\q and will exalt him with thanksgiving.
\q
\v 31 That will please Yahweh better than an ox
\q or a bull that has horns and hooves.
 
\s5
\q
\v 32 The meek have seen it and are glad;
\q you who seek after God, let your hearts live.
\q
\v 33 For Yahweh hears the needy
\q and does not despise his prisoners.
 
\s5
\q
\v 34 Let heaven and earth praise him,
\q the seas and everything that moves in them.
\q
\v 35 For God will save Zion and will rebuild the cities of Judah;
\q the people will live there and have it as a possession.
\q
\v 36 His servants’ descendants will inherit it;
\q and those who love his name will live there.

\d For the chief musician. A psalm of David; to bring to remembrance.
\b
\q
\v 1 Save me, God! 
\q Yahweh, come quickly and help me.
\q
\v 2 Let those who try to take my life 
\q be ashamed and humiliated;
\q let them be turned back and brought to dishonor,
\q those who take pleasure in my pain.
\q
\v 3 Let them be turned back because of their shame,
\q those who say, “Aha, aha.”
 
\s5
\q
\v 4 Let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you;
\q let those who love your salvation always say,
\q “May God be praised.”
\q
\v 5 But I am poor and needy;
\q hurry to me, God;
\q you are my help and you rescue me.
\q Yahweh, do not delay.

\q
\v 1 In you, Yahweh, I take refuge;

\q
\v 2 Rescue me and make me safe in your righteousness;
\q turn your ear to me and save me.
\q
\v 3 Be to me a rock for refuge where I may always go;
\q you have given a command to save me,
\q for you are my rock and my fortress.
 
\s5
\q
\v 4 Rescue me, my God, out of the hand of the wicked,
\q out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.
\q
\v 5 For you are my hope, Lord Yahweh.
\q I have trusted in you ever since I was a child.
 
\s5
\q
\v 6 By you I have been supported from the womb;
\q you are he who took me out of my mother’s belly;
\q my praise will be always about you.
\q
\v 7 I am an example to many people;
\q you are my strong refuge.
 
\s5
\q
\v 8 My mouth will be filled with your praise
\q and with your honor all the day.
\q
\v 9 Do not throw me away in my time of old age;
\q do not abandon me when my strength fails.
 
\s5
\q
\v 10 For my enemies are talking about me;
\q those who watch for my life are plotting together.
\q
\v 11 They say, “God has forsaken him;
\q pursue and take him, for there is no one to save him.”
 
\s5
\q
\v 12 God, do not be far from me;
\q my God, hurry to help me.
\q
\v 13 Let them be put to shame and consumed, those who are hostile to my life;
\q let them be covered with rebuke and dishonor, those who seek my hurt.
 
\s5
\q
\v 14 But I will always hope in you
\q and will praise you more and more.
\q
\v 15 My mouth will tell about your righteousness
\q and your salvation all the day,
\q although I cannot understand it.
\q
\v 16 I will go to them with the mighty acts of the Lord Yahweh;
\q I will make mention of your righteousness, yours alone.
 
\s5
\q
\v 17 God, you have taught me from my youth;
\q even now I declare your wonderful deeds.
\q
\v 18 Indeed, even when I am old and gray-headed, God, do not forsake me,
\q as I have been declaring your strength to the next generation,
\q your power to everyone who is to come.
 
\s5
\q
\v 19 Your righteousness also, God, is very high;
\q you who have done great things, God, who is like you?
\q
\v 20 You who have shown us many severe troubles
\q will revive us again
\q and will bring us up again from the depths of the earth.
 
\s5
\q
\v 21 May you increase my honor;
\q turn again and comfort me.
\q
\v 22 I will also give thanks to you with the harp
\q for your trustworthiness, my God;
\q to you I will sing praises with the harp,
\q Holy One of Israel.
 
\s5
\q
\v 23 My lips will shout for joy when I sing praises to you—
\q even I  whom  you have redeemed.
\q
\v 24 My tongue will also talk about your righteousness all day long;
\q for they have been put to shame and are confused, those who sought my hurt.

\b
\q
\v 1 Give the king your righteous decrees, God,

\q
\v 2 May he judge your people with righteousness
\q and your poor with justice.
\q
\v 3 May the mountains produce peace for the people;
\q may the hills produce righteousness.
 
\s5
\q
\v 4 May he judge the poor of the people;

\q and break in pieces the oppressor.
\q
\v 5 May they honor you while the sun endures,
\q and as long as the moon lasts throughout all generations.
 
\s5
\q
\v 6 May he come down like rain on the mown grass,

\q
\v 7 May the righteous flourish in his days,
\q and may there be an abundance of peace till the moon is no more.
 
\s5
\q
\v 8 May he have dominion from sea to sea,

\q
\v 9 May those who live in the wilderness bow down before him;

\v 10 May the kings of Tarshish and of the islands render tribute;
\q may the kings of Sheba and Seba offer gifts.
 
\s5
\q
\v 11 Indeed, may all kings fall down before him;

\q
\v 12 For he helps the needy person who cries out
\q and the poor person who has no other helper.

\q
\v 13 He has pity on the poor and needy,

\s5
\c 73
\d A psalm of Asaph.
\b
\q
\v 1 Surely God is good to Israel,
\q to those with a pure heart.
\q
\v 2 But as for me, my feet almost slipped;
\q my feet almost slipped out from under me
\q
\v 3 because I was envious of the arrogant
\q when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
 
\s5
\q
\v 4 For they have no pain until their death,
\q but they are strong and well fed.
\q
\v 5 They are free from the burdens of other men;
\q they are not afflicted like other men.
 
\s5
\q
\v 6 Pride adorns them like a necklace around their neck;
\q violence clothes them like a robe.
\q
\v 7 Out of such blindness comes sin;
\q evil thoughts pass through their hearts.
 
\s5
\q
\v 8 They mockingly say evil things;
\q they proudly threaten violence.
\q
\v 9 They speak against the heavens,
\q and their tongues roam through the earth.
 
\s5
\q
\v 10 Therefore God's people turn to them
\q and drink deeply at their words.
\q
\v 11 They say, "How does God know?
\q  Does God know what goes on?"
\q
\v 12 Take notice: these people are wicked;
\q they are always carefree, becoming richer and richer.
 
\s5
\q
\v 13 Surely it is in vain that I have guarded my heart
\q and washed my hands in innocence.
\q
\v 14 For all the day long have I been afflicted
\q and disciplined every morning.
\q
\v 15 If I had said, "I will say these things,"
\q then I would have betrayed this generation of your children.
 
\s5
\q
\v 16 Though I tried to understand these things,
\q it was too difficult for me.
\q
\v 17 Then I went into God's sanctuary
\q and came to understand their fate.
 
\s5
\q
\v 18 Surely you put them in slippery places;
\q you bring them down to ruin.
\q
\v 19 How they become a wilderness in a moment!
\q They come to an end and are finished in awful terrors.
\q
\v 20 They are like a dream after one wakes up;
\q2 Lord, when you arise, you will think nothing of those dreams.
 
\s5
\q
\v 21 For my heart was grieved,
\q and I was deeply wounded.
\q
\v 22 I was ignorant and lacked insight;
\q I was like a senseless animal before you.
 
\s5
\q
\v 23 Yet I am always with you;
\q you hold my right hand.
\q
\v 24 You will guide me with your advice
\q and afterward receive me to glory.
 
\s5
\q
\v 25 Whom have I in heaven but you?
\q There is no one on earth that I desire but you.
\q
\v 26 My flesh and my heart grow weak,
\q but God is the strength of my heart forever.
 
\s5
\q
\v 27 Those who are far from you will perish;
\q you will destroy all those who are unfaithful
to you.
\q
\v 28 But as for me, all I need to do is to draw near to God.
\q I have made the Lord Yahweh my refuge.
\q I will declare all your deeds.

\c 74
\d A maschil of Asaph.
\b
\q
\v 1 God, why have you rejected us forever?
\q Why does your anger burn against the sheep of your pasture?
\q
\v 2 Call to mind your people, whom you redeemed in ancient times,
\q whom you have purchased to be your own heritage,
\q and Mount Zion, where you live.
 
\s5
\q
\v 3 Come look at the complete ruins,
\q all the damage that the enemy has done in the sanctuary.
\q
\v 4 Your adversaries roared in the middle of your sanctuary;
\q they set up their battle flags.
\q
\v 5 They hacked away with axes
\q as in a thick forest.
\q
\v 6 They smashed and broke down all the engravings;
\q they broke them with axes and hammers.
 
\s5
\q
\v 7 They set your sanctuary on fire;
\q they desecrated where you live, knocking it
to the ground.
\q
\v 8 They said in their hearts, "We will destroy them all."
\q They burned up all of your meeting places in the land.
 
\s5
\q
\v 9 We do not see any more miraculous signs from God;
\q there is no prophet any more,
\q and no one among us knows how long this will last.
\q
\v 10 How long, God, will the enemy throw insults at you?
\q Will the enemy blaspheme your name forever?
\q
\v 11 Why do you hold back your hand, your right hand?
\q Take your right hand from your garment and destroy them.
\b
 
\s5
\q
\v 12 Yet God has been my king from ancient times,
\q bringing salvation on the earth.
\q
\v 13 You divided the sea by your strength;
\q you smashed  the heads of the sea monsters in the waters.
 
\s5
\q
\v 14 You crushed the heads of leviathan;
\q you fed him to those living in the wilderness.
\q
\v 15 You broke open springs and streams;
\q you dried up flowing rivers.
 
\s5
\q
\v 16 The day is yours, and the night is yours also;
\q you set the sun and moon in place.
\q
\v 17 You have set all the borders of the earth;
\q you have made summer and winter.
 
\s5
\q
\v 18 Call to mind how  the enemy hurled insults at you, Yahweh,
\q and that a foolish people has blasphemed your name.
\q
\v 19 Do not hand over the life of your dove to a wild animal.
\q Do not forget the life of your oppressed people forever.
 
\s5
\q
\v 20 Call to mind your covenant,
\q for the dark regions of the earth are full of places of violence.
\q
\v 21 Do not let  the oppressed be turned back in shame;
\q may the poor and oppressed praise your name.
 
\s5
\q
\v 22 Arise, God; defend your own honor;
\q call to mind how fools insult you all day long.
\q
\v 23 Do not forget the voice of your adversaries
\q or the uproar of those who continually defy you.

\q
\v 5 Do not be so sure of victory;
\q do not speak with your head held so high."
\q
\v 6 Victory does not come from the east, from the west,
\q or from the wilderness.
 
\s5
\q
\v 7 But God is the judge;
\q he brings one down and raises up another.
\q
\v 8 For Yahweh holds a cup in his hand of foaming wine,
\q which is mixed with spices, and pours it out.
\q Surely all the wicked of the earth will drink it to the last drop.
 
\s5
\q
\v 9 But I will continually tell what you have done;

\q All the warriors were helpless.

\q
\v 6 At your rebuke, God of Jacob,
\q both rider and horse fell asleep.
\q
\v 7 You, yes you, are to be feared;
\q who can stand in your sight when you are angry?
 
\s5
\q
\v 8 Your judgment came from heaven;

\q
\v 9 You, God, arose to execute judgment
\q and to save all the oppressed of the earth.

\q
\v 7 Will the Lord reject me forever?
\q Will he never again show me favor?
 
\s5
\q
\v 8 Was his covenant faithfulness gone forever?
\q Had  his promise failed forever?
\q
\v 9 Had God forgotten to be gracious?
\q Had his anger shut off his compassion?

\s5
\c 78
\d A maschil of Asaph.
\b
\q
\v 1 Hear my teaching, my people,
\q listen to the words of my mouth.
\q
\v 2 I will open my mouth in parables;
\q I will sing about hidden things about the past.
 
\s5
\q
\v 3 These are things that we have heard and learned,
\q things that our ancestors have told us.
\q
\v 4 We will not keep them from their descendants.
\q We will tell the next generation about the praiseworthy deeds of Yahweh,
\q his strength, and the wonders that he has done.
 
 
\s5
\q
\v 5 For he established covenant decrees in Jacob
\q and appointed a law in Israel.
\q He commanded our ancestors
\q that they were to teach them to their children.
\q
\v 6 He commanded this so that the generation to come might know his decrees, the children not yet born,
\q who should tell them in turn to their own children.
 
\s5
\q
\v 7 Then they would place their hope in God
\q and not forget his deeds
\q but keep his commandments.
\q
\v 8 Then they would not be like their ancestors,
\q who were a stubborn and rebellious generation,
\q a generation whose hearts were not right,
\q and whose spirits were not committed and faithful to God.
 
\s5
\q
\v 9 The Ephraimites were armed with bows,
\q but they turned back on the day of battle.
\q
\v 10 They did not keep the covenant with God,
\q and they refused to obey his law.
\q
\v 11 They forgot his deeds,
\q the wonderful things that he had shown them.
 
\s5
\q
\v 12 Marvelous things he did in the sight of their ancestors
\q in the land of Egypt, in the land of Zoan.
\q
\v 13 He divided the sea and led them across it;
\q he made the waters to stand like walls.
\q
\v 14 In the daytime he led them with a cloud
\q and all the night with the light of fire.
 
\s5
\q
\v 15 He split the rocks in the wilderness,
\q and he gave them water abundantly, enough to fill the depths of the sea.
\q
\v 16 He made streams flow out of the rock
\q and made the water flow like rivers.
 
\s5
\q
\v 17 Yet they continued to sin against him,
\q rebelling against the Most High in the wilderness.
\q
\v 18 They challenged God in their hearts
\q by asking for food to satisfy their appetites.
 
\s5
\q
\v 19 They spoke against God;
\q they said, "Can God really lay out a table for us in the wilderness?
\q
\v 20 See, when he struck the rock, waters gushed out
\q and streams overflowed.
\q But can he give bread also?
\q Will he provide meat for his people?"
 
\s5
\q
\v 21 When Yahweh heard this, he was angry;
\q so his fire burned against Jacob,
\q and his anger attacked Israel,
\q
\v 22 because they did not believe in God
\q and did not trust in his salvation.
 
\s5
\q
\v 23 Yet he commanded the skies above
\q and opened the doors of the sky.
\q
\v 24 He rained down manna for them to eat,
\q and gave them the grain from heaven.
\q
\v 25 People ate the bread of angels.
\q He sent them food in abundance.
 
\s5
\q
\v 26 He caused the east wind to blow in the sky,
\q and by his power he guided the south wind.
\q
\v 27 He rained down meat on them like dust,
\q birds as numerous as the sands of the sea.
\q
\v 28 They fell in the middle of their camp,
\q all around their tents.
 
\s5
\q
\v 29 So they ate and were full.
\q He gave them what they craved.
\q
\v 30 But they had not yet filled up;
\q their food was still in their mouths.
 
\s5
\q
\v 31 Then God's anger attacked them
\q and killed the strongest of them.
\q He brought down the young men of Israel.
\q
\v 32 Despite this, they continued to sin
\q and did not believe his wonderful deeds.
 
\s5
\q
\v 33 Therefore God cut short their days;
\q their years were filled with terror.
\q
\v 34 Whenever God afflicted them, they would start to seek him,
\q and they would return and look earnestly for him.
 
\s5
\q
\v 35 They would call to mind that God was their rock
\q and that the Most High God was their rescuer.
\q
\v 36 But they would flatter him with their mouth
\q and lie to him with their words.
\q
\v 37 For their hearts were not firmly fixed on him,
\q and they were not faithful to his covenant.
 
\s5
\q
\v 38 Yet he, being merciful, forgave their iniquity and did not destroy
them.
\q Yes, many times he held back his anger
\q and did not stir up all his wrath.
 
\s5
\q
\v 39 He called to mind that they were made of flesh,
\q a wind that passes away and does not return.
\q
\v 40 How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness
\q and grieved him in the barren regions!
\q
\v 41 Again and again they challenged God
\q and offended the Holy One of Israel.
 
\s5
\q
\v 42 They did not think about his power,
\q how he had rescued them from the enemy
\q
\v 43 when he performed his terrifying signs in Egypt
\q and his wonders in the region of Zoan.
 
\s5
\q
\v 44 He turned the Egyptians' rivers to blood
\q so that they could not drink from their streams.
\q
\v 45 He sent swarms of flies that devoured them
\q and frogs that overran their land.
\q
\v 46 He gave their crops to the grasshopper
\q and their labor to the locust.
 
\s5
\q
\v 47 He destroyed their vines with hail
\q and their sycamore trees with more hail.
\q
\v 48 He rained hail on their cattle
\q and hurled lightning bolts at their livestock.
\q
\v 49 The fierceness of his anger lashed out against them.
\q He sent wrath, fury, and trouble
\q like agents who bring disaster.
 
\s5
\q
\v 50 He leveled a path for his anger;
\q he did not spare them from death
\q but gave them over to the plague.
\q
\v 51 He killed all the firstborn in Egypt,
\q the firstborn of their strength in the tents of Ham.
 
\s5
\q
\v 52 He led his own people out like sheep
\q and guided them through the wilderness like a flock.
\q
\v 53 He led them secure and unafraid,
\q but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
 
\s5
\q
\v 54 Then he brought them to the border of his holy land,
\q to this mountain that his right hand acquired.
\q
\v 55 He drove out the nations from before them
\q and assigned them their inheritance;
\q he settled the tribes of Israel in their tents.
 
\s5
\q
\v 56 Yet they challenged and defied the Most High God
\q and did not keep his solemn commands.
\q
\v 57 They were unfaithful and acted  treacherously like their fathers;
\q they were as undependable as a faulty bow.
 
\s5
\q
\v 58 For they made him angry with their pagan shrines
\q and provoked him to jealous anger with their idols.
\q
\v 59 When God heard this, he was angry
\q and completely rejected Israel.
 
\s5
\q
\v 60 He abandoned the sanctuary of Shiloh,
\q the tent where he had lived among people.
\q
\v 61 He allowed his strength to be captured
\q and gave his glory into the enemy's hand.
 
\s5
\q
\v 62 He handed his people over to the sword,
\q and he was angry with his heritage.
\q
\v 63 Fire devoured their young men,
\q and their young women had no wedding songs.
 
\s5
\q
\v 64 Their priests fell by the sword,
\q and their widows could not weep.
\q
\v 65 Then the Lord awakened as one from sleep,
\q like a warrior who shouts because of wine.
\q
\v 66 He drove his adversaries back;
\q he put them to everlasting shame.
 
\s5
\q
\v 67 He rejected the tent of Joseph,
\q and he did not chose the tribe of Ephraim.
\q
\v 68 He chose the tribe of Judah
\q and Mount Zion that he loved.
\q
\v 69 He built his sanctuary like the heavens,
\q like the earth that he has established forever.
 
\s5
\q
\v 70 He chose David, his servant,
\q and took him from the sheepfolds.
\q
\v 71 He took him from following the ewes with their young, and he brought him
\q to be shepherd of Jacob, his people, and of Israel, his heritage.
\q
\v 72 David shepherded them with the integrity of his heart,
\q and he guided them with the skill of his hands.

\d A psalm of Asaph.
\b
\q
\v 1 God, foreign nations have come into your inheritance;
\q they have defiled the temple or your holiness;
\q they have turned Jerusalem into a heap of ruins.
\q
\v 2 They have given the dead bodies of your servants as food to the birds of the skies,
\q the bodies of your faithful people to the beasts of the earth.
\q
\v 3 They have shed their blood like water around Jerusalem,
\q and there was none to bury them.
 
\s5
\q
\v 4 We have become a reproach for our neighbors to make,
\q mocking and derision to those who are around us.
\q
\v 5 How long, Yahweh? Will you stay angry forever?
\q How long will your jealous anger burn like fire?
 
\s5
\q
\v 6 Pour out your wrath on the nations that do not know you
\q and on the kingdoms that do not call upon your name.
\q
\v 7 For they have devoured Jacob
\q and destroyed his villages.
 
\s5
\q
\v 8 Do not hold  the sins of our forefathers against us; 
\q may your merciful actions come to us,
\q for we are very low.
\q
\v 9 Help us, God of our salvation, for the sake of the glory of your name;
\q save us and forgive our sins for your name’s sake.
 
\s5
\q
\v 10 Why should the nations say, "Where is their God?"
\q May the blood of your servants that was shed
\q be avenged on the nations before our eyes.
\q
\v 11 May the groans of the prisoners come before you;
\q with the greatness of your power keep the children of death alive.
 
\s5
\q
\v 12 Pay back into the laps of our neighboring countries seven times as much 
\q as the insults with which they have insulted you, Lord.
\q
\v 13 So we your people and sheep of your pasture
\q will give you thanks forever.
\q We will tell your praises to all generations.

\q I am hemmed in and I cannot escape.
 
\s5
\q
\v 9 My eyes grow weary from trouble;
\q All day long I call out to you, Yahweh;

\q
\v 10 Will you do wonders for the dead?
\q Will those who have died rise and praise you? 
\qs Selah\qs*
 
\s5
\q
\v 11 Will your covenant faithfulness be proclaimed in the grave,
\q your loyalty in the place of the dead?
\q
\v 12 Will your wonderful deeds be known in the darkness,
\q or your righteousness in the place of forgetfulness?
 
\s5
\q
\v 13 But I cry to you, Yahweh;
\q in the morning my prayer comes before you.
\q
\v 14 Yahweh, why do you reject me?
\q Why do you hide your face from me?
 
\s5
\q
\v 15 I have always been afflicted and on the verge of death since my youth.
\q I have suffered from your terrors; I can do nothing. 
\q
\v 16 Your angry actions have passed over me,
\q and your terrifying deeds have annihilated me.
 
\s5
\q
\v 17 They surround me like water all the day long;
\q they have all encircled me.
\q
\v 18 You have removed every friend and acquaintance from me.
\q My only acquaintance is the darkness.

\q
\v 1 I will sing of Yahweh's acts of covenant faithfulness forever.

\s5
\q
\v 3 "I have made a covenant with my chosen one,

\q Who among the sons of the gods is like Yahweh?
 
\s5
\q
\v 7 He is a God who is honored in the council of the holy ones
\q and is more awesome than all who surround him.
\q
\v 8 Yahweh, God of hosts,

\q Your truthfulness surrounds you.
 
\s5
\q
\v 9 You rule the raging sea;

\q
\v 10 You crushed Rahab as one who is killed.
\q You scattered your enemies with your strong arm.
 
\s5
\q
\v 11 The heavens belong to you, and the earth also.
\q You made the world and all it contains.

\b
 
\s5
\q
\v 19 Long ago you spoke in a vision to your faithful ones;

\q
\v 20 I have chosen David my servant;

\q
\v 24 My truth and my covenant faithfulness will be with him;

\v 25 I will place his hand over the sea

\q
\v 39 You have renounced the covenant of your servant.
\q You have desecrated his crown on the ground.

\v 40 You have broken down all his walls.

\ms Book Four
\d A prayer of Moses the man of God.
\b
\q
\v 1 Lord, you have been our refuge
\q throughout all generations.
\q
\v 2 Before the mountains were formed,
\q or you formed the earth and the world,
\q from everlasting to everlasting, you are God.
 
\s5
\q
\v 3 You return man to dust,
\q and you say, "Return, you descendants of mankind."
\q
\v 4 For a thousand years in your sight
\q are as yesterday when it is past,
\q and as a watch in the night.
 
\s5
\q
\v 5 You sweep them away as with a flood and they sleep;
\q in the morning they are like the grass that sprouts up.
\q
\v 6 In the morning it blooms and grows up;
\q in the evening it withers and dries up.
 
\s5
\q
\v 7 Truly, we are consumed in your anger,
\q and in your wrath we are terrified.
\q
\v 8 You have set our iniquities before you,
\q our hidden sins in the light of your presence.
 
\s5
\q
\v 9 Our life passes away under your wrath;
\q our years quickly pass like a sigh.
\q
\v 10 Our years are seventy,
\q or even eighty if we are healthy;
\q but even our best years are marked by trouble and sorrow.
\q Yes, they pass quickly, and we fly away.
 
\s5
\q
\v 11 Who knows the intensity of your anger;
\q your wrath matches the fear it inspires?
\q
\v 12 So teach us to consider our life
\q so that we might live wisely.
\q
\v 13 Turn back, Yahweh! How long will it be?
\q Have pity on your servants.
 
\s5
\q
\v 14 Satisfy us in the morning with your covenant faithfulness
\q so that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.
\q
\v 15 Make us glad in proportion to the days you afflicted us
\q and to the years we have experienced trouble.
\q
\v 16 Let your servants see your work,
\q and let our children see your majesty.
 
\s5
\q
\v 17 May the favor of the Lord our God be ours;
\q prosper the work of our hands;
\q indeed, prosper the work of our hands.
 



\s5
\c 91
\p
\q
\v 1 He who lives in the shelter of the Most High
\q will stay in the shadow of the Almighty.
\q
\v 2 I will say of Yahweh, "He is my shelter and my fortress,
\q my God, in whom I trust."
 
\s5
\q
\v 3 For he will rescue you from the snare of the hunter
\q and from the deadly plague.
\q
\v 4 He will cover you with his wings,
\q and under his wings you will find refuge.
\q His trustworthiness is a shield and protection.
 
\s5
\q
\v 5 You will not be afraid of terror in the night,
\q or of the arrow that flies by day,
\q
\v 6 or of the plague that roams around in the darkness,
\q or of the disease that comes at noontime.
\q
\v 7 A thousand may fall at your side
\q and ten thousand at your right hand,
\q but it will not reach you.
 
\s5
\q
\v 8 You will only observe
\q and see the punishment of the wicked.
\q
\v 9 For Yahweh is my refuge!
\q Make the Most High your refuge also.
 
\s5
\q
\v 10 No evil will overtake you;
\q no affliction will come near your home.
\q
\v 11 For he will direct his angels to protect you,
\q to guard you in all your ways.
 
\s5
\q
\v 12 They will lift you up with their hand
\q so that you will not slip and fall on a stone.
\q
\v 13 You will crush lions and adders under your feet;
\q you will trample on young lions and serpents.
 
\s5
\q
\v 14 Because he is devoted to me, I will rescue him.
\q I will protect him because he is loyal to me.
\q
\v 15 When he calls  to me, I will answer him.
\q I will be with him in trouble;
\q I will give him victory and will honor him.
\q
\v 16 I will satisfy him with long life
\q and show him my salvation.

\c 92
\d A psalm, a song for the sabbath day.
\b
\q
\v 1 It is a good thing to give thanks to Yahweh
\q and to sing praises to your name, Most High,
\q
\v 2 to proclaim your covenant faithfulness in the morning
\q and your truthfulness every night,
\q
\v 3 with a harp of ten strings 
\q and with the melody of the lyre.
 
\s5
\q
\v 4 For you, Yahweh, have made me glad through your deeds.
\q I will sing for joy because of  the deeds of your hands.
\q
\v 5 How great are your deeds, Yahweh!
\q Your thoughts are very deep.
 
\s5
\q
\v 6 A brutish person does not know,
\q nor does a fool understand this:
\q
\v 7 When the wicked sprout like the grass,
\q and even when all the evildoers thrive,
\q still they are doomed to eternal destruction.
 
\s5
\q
\v 8 But you, Yahweh, will reign forever.
\q
\v 9 Indeed, look at your enemies, Yahweh;
\q all the evildoers are scattered.
 
\s5
\q
\v 10 You have exalted my horn like the horn of the wild ox;
\q I am anointed with fresh oil.
\q
\v 11 My eyes have seen the downfall of my enemies;
\q my ears have heard of the doom of my evil foes.
 
\s5
\q
\v 12 The righteous will flourish like the palm tree;
\q they will grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
\q
\v 13 They are planted in the house of Yahweh;
\q they flourish in the courts of our God.
 
\s5
\q
\v 14 They bear fruit even when they are old;
\q they stay fresh and green,
\q
\v 15 to proclaim that Yahweh is just.
\q He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.
 




\s5
\c 93
\p
\q
\v 1 Yahweh reigns; he is robed in majesty;
\q Yahweh is clothed with strength; he wears strength like a belt.
\q The world is firmly established; it cannot be moved.
\q
\v 2 Your throne is established from ancient times;
\q you are from everlasting.

\s5
\q
\v 3 The oceans rise, Yahweh;
\q they have lifted up their voice;
\q the oceans' waves crash and roar.
\q
\v 4 Above the crashing of many waves,
\q the mighty breakers of the sea,
\q Yahweh on high is mighty.

\q
\v 1 Yahweh, God who avenges,
\q God who avenges, shine over us.
\q
\v 2 Rise up, judge of the earth,

\s5
\q
\v 3 Yahweh, how long will the wicked,
\q how long will the wicked rejoice?
\q
\v 4 They pour out arrogant and defiant speeches,
\q  and they all boast.
 
\s5
\q
\v 5 They crush your people, Yahweh;
\q they afflict the nation that belongs to you.
\q
\v 6 They kill the widow and the alien,
\q and they murder the fatherless.
\q
\v 7 They say, "Yahweh will not see,
\q the God of Jacob does not take notice of it."
 
\s5
\q
\v 8 Understand, you stupid people;
\q you fools, when will you ever learn?
\q
\v 9 He who made the ear, does he not hear?
\q He who formed the eye, does he not see?
 
\s5
\q
\v 10 He who disciplines the nations, does he not correct?
\q He is the one who gives knowledge to man.
\q
\v 11 Yahweh knows the thoughts of men,
\q that they are corrupt.
 
\s5
\q
\v 12 Blessed is the one whom you instruct, Yahweh,
\q the one whom you teach from your law.
\q
\v 13 You give him rest in times of trouble
\q until a pit is dug for the wicked.
 
\s5
\q
\v 14 For Yahweh will not forsake his people
\q or abandon his inheritance.
\q
\v 15 For justice will prevail;
\q and all the upright will follow it.
\q
\v 16 Who will rise up to defend me against the evildoers?
\q Who will stand up for me against the wicked?
 
\s5
\q
\v 17 Unless Yahweh had been my help,
\q soon, I would be lying down in the place of silence.
\q
\v 18 When I said, "My foot is slipping,"
\q Your covenant faithfulness, Yahweh, held me up.
\q
\v 19 When cares within me threaten to overwhelm me, your comfort makes me happy.
 
\s5
\q
\v 20 Can wicked rulers be allied with you,
\q those who create injustice by statute?
\q
\v 21 They conspire together to take the life of the righteous
\q and they condemn the innocent to death.
 
\s5
\q
\v 22 But Yahweh has been my high tower,
\q and my God has been the rock of my refuge.
\q
\v 23 He will bring on them their own iniquity
\q and will cut them off in their own wickedness.
\q Yahweh our God will cut them off.

\q
\v 4 In his hand are the depths of the earth;

\q
\v 6 Oh come, let us worship and bow down;

\s5
\q
\v 10 For forty years I was angry with that generation

\q
\v 5 With my continual groaning,

\q
\v 6 I am like a pelican of the wilderness;
\q I have become like an owl in the ruins.
 
\s5
\q
\v 7 I lie awake like a solitary bird,
\q  alone on the housetop.
\q
\v 8 My enemies taunt me all day long;
\q those who mock me use my name in curses.
 
\s5
\q
\v 9 I eat ashes like bread

\v 10 Because of your raging anger,

\v 11 My days are like a shadow that fades,

\s5
\q
\v 13 You will rise up and have mercy on Zion.
\q Now is the  time to have mercy upon her;
\q the appointed time has come.
\q
\v 14 For your servants hold her stones dear

\q
\v 15 The nations will respect your name, Yahweh,
\q and all the kings of the earth will honor your glory.
\q
\v 16 Yahweh will rebuild Zion
\q and will appear in his glory.
 
\s5
\q
\v 17 At that time, he will respond to the prayer of the destitute;
\q he will not reject their prayer.
\q
\v 18 This will be written for future generations,
\q and a people not yet born will praise Yahweh.
 
\s5
\q
\v 19 For he has looked down from the holy heights;
\q from heaven Yahweh has viewed the earth,
\q
\v 20 to hear the groaning of the prisoners,
\q to release those who were condemned to death.
 
\s5
\q
\v 21 Then men will proclaim the name of Yahweh in Zion
\q and his praise in Jerusalem
\q
\v 22 when the peoples and kingdoms gather together
\q to serve Yahweh.
\b
 
\s5
\q
\v 23 He has taken away my strength in the middle of life.
\q He has shortened my days.
\q
\v 24 I said, "My God, do not take me away in the middle of life;
\q you are here throughout all generations.
 
\s5
\q
\v 25 In ancient times you set the earth in place;
\q the heavens are the work of your hands.
\q
\v 26 They will perish, but you will remain;
\q they will all grow old like a garment;
\q like clothing, you will remove them, and they will disappear.
\q
\v 27 But you are the same,
\q and your years will have no end.
 
\s5
\q
\v 28 The children of your servants will live on,
\q and their descendants will live in your presence."
 
 




\s5
\c 103
\d A psalm of David.
\b
\q
\v 1 I give praise to Yahweh with all my life,
\q and with all that is within me, I  give praise to his holy name.
\q
\v 2 I give praise to Yahweh with all my life, 
\q and I remember all of his good deeds.
 
\s5
\q
\v 3 He forgives all your sins;
\q he heals all your diseases.
\q
\v 4 He redeems your life from destruction;
\q he crowns you with covenant faithfulness and acts of tender mercy.
\q
\v 5 He satisfies your life with good things
\q so that your youth is renewed like the eagle.
 
\s5
\q
\v 6 Yahweh does what is fair
\q and does acts of justice for all who are oppressed.
\q
\v 7 He made known his ways to Moses,
\q his deeds to the descendants of Israel.
\q
\v 8 Yahweh is merciful and gracious;
\q he is patient; he has great covenant loyalty.
 
\s5
\q
\v 9 He will not always discipline;
\q he is not always angry.
\q
\v 10 He does not deal with us as our sins deserve
\q or repay us for what our sins demand. 
 
\s5
\q
\v 11 For as the skies are high above the earth,
\q so great is his covenant faithfulness toward those who honor him.
\q
\v 12 As far as the east is from the west,
\q this is how far he has removed the guilt of our sins from us.
\q
\v 13 As a father has compassion on his children,
\q so Yahweh has compassion on those who honor him.
 
\s5
\q
\v 14 For he knows how we are formed;
\q he knows that we are dust.
\q
\v 15 As for man, his days are like grass;
\q he flourishes like a flower in a field.
\q
\v 16 The wind blows over it, and it disappears,
\q and no one can even tell where it once grew. 
 
\s5
\q
\v 17 But the covenant faithfulness of Yahweh is from everlasting to everlasting on those who honor him.
\q His righteousness extends to their descendants.
\q
\v 18 They keep his covenant
\q and remember to obey his instructions.
\q
\v 19 Yahweh has established his throne in the heavens,
\q and his kingdom rules over everyone.
 
\s5
\q
\v 20 Give praise to Yahweh you angels  
\q who have great strength and obey his word,
\q being obedient to his commands.
\q
\v 21 Give praise to Yahweh all his angel armies,
\q you are his servants who carry out his will.
\q
\v 22 Give praise to Yahweh all his creatures,
\q in all the places where he reigns.
\q I will give praise to Yahweh with all my life.
 




\s5
\c 104
\p
\q
\v 1  I give praise to Yahweh with all my life,
\q Yahweh my God, you are very magnificent;
\q you are clothed with splendor and majesty.
\q
\v 2 You cover yourself with light as with a garment;
\q you spread out the heavens like a tent curtain.
\q
\v 3 You lay the beams of your chambers on  the clouds;
\q you make the clouds your chariot;
\q you walk on the wings of the wind.
 
\s5
\q
\v 4 He makes the winds his messengers,
\q flames of fire his servants.
\q
\v 5 He laid the foundations of the earth,
\q and it will never be moved.
 
\s5
\q
\v 6 You covered the earth with water like a garment;
\q the water covered the mountains.
\q
\v 7 Your rebuke made the waters recede;
\q at the sound of your thunderous voice they fled.
 
\s5
\q
\v 8 The mountains rose, and the valleys spread out
\q into the places that you had appointed for them.
\q
\v 9 You have set a boundary for them that they will not cross;
\q they will not cover the earth again.
 
\s5
\q
\v 10 He made springs flow into the valleys;
\q the streams flow between the mountains.
\q
\v 11 They supply water for all the animals of the field;
\q the wild donkeys quench their thirst.
\q
\v 12 By the riverbanks the birds build their nests;
\q they sing among the branches.
 
\s5
\q
\v 13 He waters the mountains from his water chambers in the sky.
\q The earth is filled with the fruit of his labor.
\q
\v 14 He makes the grass grow for the cattle
\q and plants for man to cultivate
\q so that man may produce food from the earth.
\q
\v 15 He makes wine to make man happy,
\q oil to make his face shine,
\q and food to sustain his life.
 
\s5
\q
\v 16 The trees of Yahweh are well watered;
\q he planted the cedars of Lebanon.
\q
\v 17 There the birds make their nests.
\q The stork makes the fir tree her home.
\q
\v 18 The wild goats live on the high mountains;
\q the mountain heights are a refuge for the hyraxes.
 
\s5
\q
\v 19 He appointed the moon to mark the seasons;
\q the sun knows its time for setting.
\q
\v 20 You make the darkness of the night
\q when all the beasts of the forest come out.
 
\s5
\q
\v 21 The young lions roar for their prey
\q and seek their food from God.
\q
\v 22 When the sun rises, they retreat
\q and sleep in their dens.
 
\s5
\q
\v 23 Meanwhile, people go out to their work
\q and labor away until the evening.
\q
\v 24 Yahweh, how many and varied are your works!
\q With wisdom you made them all;
\q the earth overflows with your works.
 
\s5
\q
\v 25 Over there is the sea, deep and wide,
\q teeming with innumerable creatures,
\q both small and great.
\q
\v 26 The ships travel there,
\q and Leviathan is also there, which you formed to play in the sea.
 
\s5
\q
\v 27 All these look to you to give them
\q  their food on time.
\q
\v 28 When you give to them, they gather;
\q when you open your hand, they are satisfied.
 
\s5
\q
\v 29 When you hide your face, they are troubled;
\q if you take away their breath, they die
\q and return to dust.
\q
\v 30 When you send out your Spirit, they are created,
\q and you renew the countryside.
 
\s5
\q
\v 31 May the glory of Yahweh last forever;
\q may Yahweh enjoy his creation.
\q
\v 32 He looks down on the earth, and it shakes;
\q he touches the mountains, and they smoke.
 
\s5
\q
\v 33 I will sing to Yahweh all my life;
\q I will sing praise to my God as long as I live.
\q
\v 34 May my thoughts be sweet to him;
\q I will rejoice in Yahweh.
 
\s5
\q
\v 35 May sinners vanish from the earth,
\q and let the wicked be no more.
\q I give praise to Yahweh with all my life.
\q Praise Yahweh.

\v 4 Seek Yahweh and his strength;

\q
\v 5 Recall the marvelous things he has done,
\q his miracles and the decrees from his mouth,
\q
\v 6 you descendants of Abraham his servant,
\q you people of Jacob, his chosen ones.
 
\s5
\q
\v 7 He is Yahweh, our God.
\q His decrees are on all the earth.
\q
\v 8 He keeps in mind his covenant forever,
\q the word that he commanded for a thousand generations.
 
\s5
\q
\v 9 He calls to mind the covenant that he made with Abraham
\q and his oath to Isaac.
\q
\v 10 This is what he confirmed to Jacob as a statute
\q and to Israel as an everlasting covenant.
\q
\v 11 He said, "I will give you the land of Canaan
\q as your share of your inheritance."
 
\s5
\q
\v 12  He said this when they were only few in number,
\q so very few, and were strangers in the land.
\q
\v 13 They went from nation to nation
\q and from one kingdom to another.
 
\s5
\q
\v 14 He did not allow anyone to oppress them;
\q he rebuked kings for their sakes.
\q
\v 15 He said, "Do not touch my anointed ones,
\q and do not harm my prophets."
 
\s5
\q
\v 16 He called for a famine on the land;
\q he cut off the whole supply of bread.
\q
\v 17 He sent a man ahead of them;
\q Joseph was sold as a servant.
 
\s5
\q
\v 18 His feet were bound by shackles;
\q iron chains were put on him.
\q
\v 19 until the time that his prediction came true.
\q The word of Yahweh proved him to be right.
 
\s5
\q
\v 20 The king sent servants to release him;
\q the ruler of the people set him free.
\q
\v 21 He put him in charge of his house
\q as ruler of all his possessions
\q
\v 22 to instruct his princes as he wished
\q and to teach his elders wisdom.
\q
\v 23 Then Israel came into Egypt,
\q and Jacob lived for a time in the land of Ham.
 
\s5
\q
\v 24 God increased his people greatly
\q and made them more numerous than their adversaries.
\q
\v 25 He caused their enemies to hate his people,
\q to mistreat his servants.
\q
\v 26 He sent Moses, his servant,
\q and Aaron, whom he had chosen.
\q
\v 27 They performed his signs among the Egyptians,
\q his wonders in the land of Ham.
 
\s5
\q
\v 28 He sent darkness and made that land dark,
\q but its people did not obey his commands.
\q
\v 29 He turned their water into blood
\q and killed their fish.
\q
\v 30 Their land swarmed with frogs,
\q even in the rooms of their rulers.
 
\s5
\q
\v 31 He spoke, and swarms of flies and gnats came
\q throughout their country.
\q
\v 32 He sent hail and rain,
\q with lightning and thunder, to their land.
\q
\v 33 He destroyed their vines and fig trees;
\q he broke the trees of their country.
 
\s5
\q
\v 34 He spoke, and the locusts came,
\q so many locusts.
\q
\v 35 The locusts ate up all of the vegetation in their land;
\q They ate up all the crops of the ground.
\q
\v 36 He killed every firstborn in their land,
\q the first fruits of all their strength.
 
\s5
\q
\v 37 He brought the Israelites out with silver and gold;
\q none of his tribes stumbled on the way.
\q
\v 38 Egypt was glad when they went away,
\q for the Egyptians were afraid of them.
\q
\v 39 He spread a cloud for a covering
\q and made a fire to light up the night.
 
\s5
\q
\v 40 The Israelites asked for food, and he brought quail
\q and satisfied them with bread from heaven.
\q
\v 41 He split the rock, and waters gushed from it;
\q they flowed in the wilderness like a river.
\q
\v 42 For he called to mind his holy promise
\q that he made to Abraham his servant.
 
\s5
\q
\v 43 He led his people out with joy,
\q his chosen with shouts of triumph.
\q
\v 44 He gave them the lands of the nations;
\q they took possession of the wealth of the peoples
\q
\v 45 so that they might keep his statutes 
\q and obey his laws.
\q Praise Yahweh.

\v 2 Who can recount the mighty acts of Yahweh
\q or proclaim in full all his praiseworthy deeds?
 
\s5
\q
\v 3 Blessed are those who do what is right,
\q and whose deeds are always just.
\q
\v 4 Call me to mind, Yahweh, when you show favor to your people;
\q help me when you save them.
\q
\v 5 Then I will see the prosperity of your chosen,
\q rejoice in the gladness of your nation,
\q and glory with your inheritance.
\b
 
\s5
\q
\v 6 We have sinned like our ancestors;
\q we have done wrong, and we have done evil.
\q
\v 7 Our fathers did not appreciate your marvelous deeds in Egypt;
\q they ignored your many acts of covenant faithfulness;
\q they were rebellious at the sea, the Red Sea.
 
\s5
\q
\v 8 Nevertheless, he saved them for his name’s sake
\q so that he might reveal his power.
\q
\v 9 He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up.
\q Then he led them through the depths, as through a wilderness.
 
\s5
\q
\v 10 He saved them from the hand of those who hated them,
\q and he rescued them from the power of the enemy.
\q
\v 11 But the waters covered their adversaries;
\q not one of them survived.
\q
\v 12 Then they believed his words,
\q and they sang his praise.
 
\s5
\q
\v 13 But they quickly forgot what he had done;
\q they did not wait for his instructions.
\q
\v 14 They had insatiable cravings in the wilderness,
\q and they challenged God in the desert.
\q
\v 15 He gave them their request,
\q but sent a disease that consumed their bodies.
 
\s5
\q
\v 16 In the camp they became jealous of Moses
\q and Aaron, the holy priest of Yahweh.
\q
\v 17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan
\q and covered the followers of Abiram.
\q
\v 18 Fire broke out among them;
\q the fire consumed the wicked.
 
\s5
\q
\v 19 They made a calf at Horeb
\q and worshiped a cast metal figure.
\q
\v 20 They traded the glory of God
\q for the image of a bull that eats grass.
\q
\v 21 They forgot God their Savior,
\q who had done great deeds in Egypt.
 
\s5
\q
\v 22 He had done wonderful things in the land of Ham
\q and mighty acts at the Red Sea.
\q
\v 23 He would have decreed their destruction,
\q had not Moses, his chosen one, intervened with him in the breach
\q to turn away his anger from destroying them.
 
\s5
\q
\v 24 Then they despised the fruitful land;
\q they did not believe his promise,
\q
\v 25 but grumbled in their tents,
\q and did not obey Yahweh.
 
\s5
\q
\v 26 Therefore he raised his hand and swore to them
\q that he would let them die in the desert,
\q
\v 27 scatter their descendants among the nations,
\q and scatter them in foreign lands.
 
\s5
\q
\v 28 They worshiped the Baal of Peor
\q and ate the sacrifices offered to the dead.
\q
\v 29 They provoked him to anger with their actions,
\q and a plague broke out among them.
 
\s5
\q
\v 30 Then Phinehas rose to intervene,
\q and the plague subsided.
\q
\v 31 It was counted to him as a righteous deed
\q to all generations forever.
 
\s5
\q
\v 32 They also angered Yahweh at the waters of Meribah,
\q and Moses suffered because of them.
\q
\v 33 They made Moses bitter,
\q and he spoke rashly.
\q
\v 34 They did not destroy the nations
\q as Yahweh had commanded them,
\q
\v 35 but they mingled with the nations
\q and learned their ways
\q
\v 36 and worshiped their idols,
\q which became a snare to them.
 
\s5
\q
\v 37 They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons.
\q
\v 38 They shed innocent blood,
\q the blood of their sons and of their daughters,
\q whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan,
\q desecrating the land with blood.
\q
\v 39 They were defiled by their deeds;
\q in their actions they were like prostitutes.
 
\s5
\q
\v 40 So Yahweh was angry with his people,
\q and he despised his own people.
\q
\v 41 He handed them over to the nations,
\q and those who hated them ruled over them.
 
\s5
\q
\v 42 Their enemies oppressed them,
\q and they were brought into subjection to their authority.
\q
\v 43 Many times he came to help them,
\q but they kept rebelling
\q and were brought low by their own sin.
 
\s5
\q
\v 44 Nevertheless, he paid attention to their distress
\q when he heard their cry for help.
\q
\v 45 He called to mind his covenant with them
\q and relented because of his covenant faithfulness.
\q
\v 46 He caused all their conquerers
\q to have pity on them.
\b
\s5
\q
\v 47 Save us, Yahweh, our God.
\q Gather us from among the nations
\q so that we may give thanks to your holy name
\q and glory in your praises.
\b
\q
\v 48 May Yahweh, the God of Israel, be praised 
\q from everlasting to everlasting.
\q All the people said, "Amen."

\b
 
\s5
\q
\v 4 They wandered in the wilderness on a desert road
\q and found no city in which to live.
\q
\v 5 Because they were hungry and thirsty,
\q they fainted from exhaustion.
\q
\v 6 Then they called out to Yahweh in their trouble,

\b
\q
\v 10 Some sat in darkness and in gloom,

\s5
\q
\v 11 This was because they had rebelled against God's word
\q and rejected the instruction of the Most High.
\q
\v 12 He humbled their hearts through hardship;

\q
\v 13 Then they called out to Yahweh in their trouble,

\q
\v 15 Oh that people would praise Yahweh for his covenant faithfulness

\q
\v 36 He settles the hungry there,
\q and they build a city to live in.
\q
\v 37 They build a city to plant fields in, to plant vineyards,
\q and to bring in an abundant harvest.
\q
\v 38 He blesses them so they are very numerous.
\q He does not let their cattle decrease in number.
 
\s5
\q
\v 39  They were diminished and brought low

\v 2 For the wicked and deceitful attack me;

\s5
\q
\v 4 In return for my love they slander me,

\q
\v 5 They repay me evil for good,
\q and they hate my love.
 
\s5
\q
\v 6 Appoint  a wicked man over such an enemy as these people;
\q appoint an accuser to stand at his right hand.
\q
\v 7 When he is judged, may he be found guilty;
\q may his prayer be considered sinful.
 
\s5
\q
\v 8 May his days be few;
\q may another take his office.
\q
\v 9 May his children be fatherless,
\q and may his wife be a widow.
\q
\v 10 May his children wander about and beg,
\q asking for handouts as they leave their ruined home.
 
\s5
\q
\v 11 May the creditor take all he owns;

\q
\v 12 May no one extend any kindness to him;

\q
\v 13 May his children be cut off;

\s5
\q
\v 14 May his ancestors' sins be mentioned to Yahweh;
\q and may the sin of his mother not be forgotten.
\q
\v 15 May their guilt always be before Yahweh;
\q may Yahweh cut off their memory from the earth.
\q
\v 16 May Yahweh do this because this man never bothered to show any covenant faithfulness,
\q but instead harassed the oppressed, the needy,
\q and the disheartened to death.
 
\s5
\q
\v 17 He loved cursing; may it come back upon him.
\q He hated blessing; may no blessing come to him.
\q
\v 18 He clothed himself with cursing as his garment,
\q and his curse came into his inner being like water,
\q like oil into his bones.
 
\s5
\q
\v 19 May his curses be to him like the clothes he wears to cover himself,

\s5
\q
\v 21 Yahweh my Lord, deal kindly with me for your name’s sake.
\q Because your covenant faithfulness is good, save me.
\q
\v 22 For I am oppressed and needy,

\q
\v 23 I am fading away like the shadow of the evening;
\q I am shaken off like a locust.
 
\s5
\q
\v 24 My knees are weak from fasting;

\s5
\q
\v 30 With my mouth I give great thanks to Yahweh;

\q
\v 3 What will he inflict on you, and what more besides,

\v 4 He will shoot you with the sharp arrows of warriors,

\q so our eyes look to Yahweh our God
\q until he has mercy on us.
 
\s5
\q
\v 3 Have mercy on us, Yahweh, have mercy on us,
\q for we are filled with humiliation.
\q
\v 4 We are more than full 
\q of the scoffing of the insolent
\q and with the contempt of the proud.

\b
\q

\q
\v 6 Blessed be Yahweh,

\q
\v 7 We have escaped like a bird out of the snare of the fowlers;

\q Otherwise the righteous might do what is wrong.

\q
\v 4 Do good, Yahweh, to those who are good

\q
\v 4 Like arrows in the hand of a warrior,
