\p 
\v 1 Many people have attempted to write accounts concerning those things which have been fulfilled among us. 
\v 2 Those who were eyewitnesses from the beginning and had become servants of the word, reported them to us. 
\v 3 So, it seemed good to me also, having investigated everything accurately from the beginning, to write it down for you in order, most excellent Theophilus. 
\v 4 I want you to know the certainty of the things that you were taught.

\s5
\p 
\v 5 In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a certain priest named Zechariah, from the division of Abijah. His wife was from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth. 
\v 6 They were both righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and requirements of the Lord. 
\v 7 But they did not have any children, because Elizabeth was barren, and they both were very old. 

\s5
\p
\v 8 One day while Zechariah was performing his duties as a priest before God in the order of his division,
\v 9 the priests followed their custom and chose him by lot to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense.
\v 10 The whole assembly of the people was praying outside when it was time to burn the incense.

\s5
\v 11 An angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense.
\v 12 Zechariah was troubled when he saw him, and became very afraid.
\v 13 But the angel said to him, "Do not be afraid, Zechariah, because your prayer has been heard. Your wife, Elizabeth, will bear you a son, and you will name him John.

\s5
\v 14 You will have joy and gladness because of him, and many people will rejoice at his birth.
\v 15 For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and he will not drink wine or strong drink. He will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even while in his mother’s womb. 

\s5
\v 16 He will cause many of the sons of Israel to turn back to the Lord their God.
\v 17 He will go in advance of him in the spirit and power of Elijah. He will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and cause the disobedient to walk according to the wisdom of the righteous. He will do this in order to make ready a people prepared for the Lord."

\s5
\p
\v 18 Zechariah said to the angel, "How will I know this will happen? For I am an old man, and my wife also is very old."
\v 19 The angel answered him, "I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news. 
\v 20 See, you will be silent and not able to speak until the day when these things happen, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled at the proper time."

\s5
\v 21 Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the temple.
\v 22 When he came out, he could not speak to them, and they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple. He made signs to them, but remained unable to speak.
\v 23 When his time of service was fulfilled, he went back to his house.

\s5
\p
\v 24 After these days, his wife Elizabeth conceived. She hid herself for five months, saying,
\v 25 "This is what the Lord has done for me. He watched over me, to take away my disgrace among people."

\s5
\p
\v 26 Now in the sixth month of Elizabeth's pregnancy, the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a city in Galilee, named Nazareth,
\v 27 to a virgin who was engaged to a man named Joseph. He was a descendant of David, and the virgin’s name was Mary.
\v 28 The angel came to her, and said, "Greetings, highly favored one! The Lord is with you!"
\v 29 But she was very troubled by his words, and wondered what kind of greeting this might be.

\s5
\v 30 The angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.
\v 31 See, you will become pregnant and bear a son, and you will name him Jesus.
\v 32 He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father, David.
\v 33 He will reign over the descendants of Jacob forever, and there will be no end to his kingdom."

\s5
\v 34 Then Mary said to the angel, "How will this happen, since I am a virgin?"
\v 35 The angel answered her, "The Holy Spirit will come over you and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore, the holy one who will be born will be called the Son of God.

\s5
\v 36 See, Elizabeth your relative also has conceived a son in her old age; she is in her sixth month of pregnancy, even though she was called barren.
\v 37 For nothing is impossible for God."
\v 38 Mary said, "Indeed, I am the Lord's servant. Let this happen to me according to your word." And the angel left her.


\s5
\p 
\v 39 Now in those days Mary got up and hurried to the hill country, to a city in Judea, 
\v 40 where she went into Zechariah's house and greeted Elizabeth. 
\v 41 As Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby in her womb leaped; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. 

\s5
\v 42 She raised her voice with a loud exclamation, and said, "You are blessed among women, and the fruit of your womb is blessed.
\v 43 How is it that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
\v 44 For when the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy.
\v 45 She who has believed is blessed, for the things which have been spoken to her from the Lord will be fulfilled."

\s5
\v 46 Mary said,
\q "My soul exalts the Lord,
\q \v 47 And my spirit rejoices in God my Savior.

\s5
\q \v 48 For he has paid attention to the lowly position of his servant. 
\q From now on all generations will call me blessed, 
\q \v 49 For the Mighty One has done great things for me; 
\q And his name is holy.

\s5
\q \v 50 His mercy is for generation after generation of people who fear him.
\q \v 51 He has done powerful things with his arm; 
\q he has scattered those who are proud in their heart.

\s5
\q \v 52 He has pulled down rulers from their thrones, 
\q and has raised up lowly people.
\q \v 53  He has given good things to hungry people, 
\q and has sent away rich people without anything.

\s5
\q \v 54 He has helped his servant Israel,
\q  in order to be merciful
\q \v 55 to Abraham and his descendants forever, 
\q just as he promised to our ancestors he would do."

\s5
\p 
\v 56 Mary lived with Elizabeth about three months, and then returned to her house.
\p 
\v 57 Now when it was time for Elizabeth to deliver her baby, she gave birth to a son.
\v 58 Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had been very merciful to her, and they rejoiced with her.

\s5
\p 
\v 59 Then, on the eighth day after that, they came to circumcise the baby; and they would have called him Zechariah, after the name of his father. 
\v 60 But his mother answered and said, “No, instead he will be called John.” 
\v 61 They said to her, “There is no one from among your relatives who is called by this name.”

\s5
\v 62 They gestured to his father to find out what name he wanted him to be called.
\v 63 So he asked for a writing tablet and wrote on it, "His name is John." They all were very surprised.

\s5
\v 64 Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue was freed, and he began to speak, praising God. 
\v 65 Then fear came on everyone who lived around them and everything that happened was being talked about throughout all the hill country of Judea. 
\v 66 Everyone who heard about this kept thinking about what had happened and said, “So then, what will this child become?” For they realized that the hand of the Lord was with him.

\s5
\p 
\v 67 His father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit, and he spoke this prophecy,
\q \v 68 "Praise the Lord, the God of Israel, 
\q because he has come to us and has made a way to set his people free.

\s5
\q \v 69 He has provided for us a powerful Savior
\q from among the descendants of his servant David, 
\q \v 70 just as God spoke through his holy prophets long ago. 
\q \v 71 He promised to provide for us salvation from our enemies,
\q and from the hand of everyone who hates us.

\s5
\q \v 72 He has done this to show mercy towards our ancestors,
\q And to remember his holy covenant.
\q \v 73 That covenant is the oath which he spoke to Abraham our ancestor.
\q \v 74 He made an oath to set us free from the hand of our enemies 
\q and to enable us to serve him without fear,
\q \v 75 in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.

\s5
\q \v 76 And you, my child, will be called the prophet of the Most High,
\q because you will go in advance of the Lord 
\q to prepare people for his coming, 
\q \v 77 and to help people know how they can be saved
\q through the forgiveness of their sins.

\s5
\q \v 78 Our God will forgive us because of his tender mercy. 
\q By this mercy, the Savior, who is like the morning sun, will come from heaven to help us.
\q \v 79 He will shine upon people who sit in darkness and the shadow of death; 
\q he will guide our feet into the path of peace."

\s5
\p 
\v 80 Then the child grew up, and became strong in spirit. He lived out in the desert areas until he began to appear publicly to the people of Israel.




\s5
\c 2
\p 
\v 1 Now in those days, it came about that Caesar Augustus sent out a decree ordering that a census be taken of all the people living in the Roman world.  
\v 2 This was the first census made while Quirinius was governor of Syria.  
\v 3 So everyone went to his own town to be registered for the census. 

\s5
\v 4 Joseph also departed from the city of Nazareth in Galilee and traveled to the Judean town of Bethlehem, which is known as the city of David, because he was a descendant from the family of David.  
\v 5 He went there to register along with Mary, who was engaged to him and was expecting a child.

\s5
\v 6 Now it came about that while they were there, the time came for her to deliver her baby.  
\v 7 She gave birth to a son, her firstborn child, and she wrapped him snugly in strips of cloth. Then she put him in an animal feeding trough, because there was no room for them in a guest room.

\s5
\p 
\v 8 In that same region, there were shepherds who were living out in the fields and were keeping watch over their flocks of sheep at night.  
\v 9 Suddenly, an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord was shining all around them, and they were very afraid.

\s5
\v 10 Then the angel said to them, "Do not be afraid, because I am about to announce to you good news that will bring great joy to all the people.  
\v 11 Today a savior was born for you in the city of David! He is Christ the Lord!  
\v 12 This is the sign that will be given to you, you will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth and lying in a feeding trough." 

\s5
\v 13 Suddenly with the angel there was a large number of the heavenly army praising God, and saying, 
\q1 \v 14 "Glory to God in the highest, 
\q1  and may there be peace on earth among people
\q1  with whom he is pleased."

\s5
\p 
\v 15 It came about that when the angels had gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said to each other, "Let us now go to Bethlehem, and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us."  
\v 16 They hurried there and found Mary and Joseph, and saw the baby lying in the feeding trough.

\s5
\v 17 After they had seen this, they made known to people what had been said to them about this child.  
\v 18 All who heard it were amazed at what was spoken to them by the shepherds.  
\v 19 But Mary kept thinking about all the things she had heard, treasuring them in her heart.  
\v 20 The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for everything that they had heard and seen, just as it had been spoken to them.

\s5
\p 
\v 21 When it was the eighth day and it was time to circumcise the baby, they named him Jesus, the name he had been given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.

\s5
\p 
\v 22 When the required number of days for their purification had passed, according to the law of Moses, Joseph and Mary brought their infant son up to the temple in Jerusalem to present him to the Lord.  
\v 23 As it is written in the law of the Lord, "Every male that opens the womb will be called holy to the Lord."  
\v 24 They also came to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, "a pair of doves or two young pigeons."

\s5
\v 25  Behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. This man was righteous and devout. He was waiting for the comforter of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.  
\v 26 It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.

\s5
\v 27 One day he came into the temple, led by the Holy Spirit. When the parents brought in the child, Jesus, to do for him what the custom of the law required,  
\v 28 then Simeon received him into his arms, and praised God and said,  
\q1 \v 29 "Now let your servant depart in peace, Lord, according to your word.

\s5
\q1 \v 30 For my eyes have seen your salvation,  
\q1 \v 31 which you have prepared in the sight of all peoples. 
\q1 \v 32 He will be a light for revealing truth to the Gentiles and will be the glory of your people Israel."

\s5
\p 
\v 33 The child's father and mother were amazed at the things which were spoken concerning him.  
\v 34 Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother, "Listen carefully! This child is destined for the falling and rising of many people in Israel and for a sign which is spoken against. 
\v 35 Also, a sword will pierce your own soul, so that the thoughts from many hearts may be revealed." 

\s5
\v 36 A prophetess named Anna was also there. She was the daughter of Phanuel from the tribe of Asher.  She was very advanced in years. She had lived with her husband for seven years after her marriage,  
\v 37 and then was a widow for eighty-four years. She never left the temple and was continually worshiping God with fasting and prayers, night and day.  
\v 38 At that very moment, she came up to them and began thanking God. She talked about the child to everyone who had been waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem.

\s5
\v 39 When they had finished everything they were required to do according to the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth.  
\p 
\v 40 The child grew and became strong, increasing in wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him.

\s5
\p 
\v 41 His parents went every year to Jerusalem for the Festival of the Passover.  
\v 42 When he was twelve years old, they again went up at the customary time for the feast.  
\v 43 After they had stayed the full number of days for the feast, they began to return home. But the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem and his parents did not know it.  
\v 44 They assumed that he was with the group that was traveling with them, so they traveled a day's journey. Then they started looking for him among their relatives and friends.

\s5
\v 45 When they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem and started looking for him there.  
\v 46 It came about that after three days, they found him in the temple, sitting in the middle of the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.  
\v 47 All who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.

\s5
\v 48 When they saw him, they were astonished. His mother said to him, "Son, why have you treated us this way? Listen, your father and I have been anxiously searching for you."
\v 49 He said to them, "Why were you searching for me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father’s house?"  
\v 50 But they did not understand what he meant by those words.

\s5
\v 51 Then he went back home with them to Nazareth and was obedient to them. His mother treasured all these things in her heart.  
\p 
\v 52 But Jesus continued to grow in wisdom and stature, and increased in favor with God and people.




\s5
\c 3
\p 
\v 1 Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, while Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, Herod was tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip was tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias was tetrarch of Abilene,  
\v 2 and during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John, the son of Zechariah, in the wilderness. 

\s5
\v 3 He traveled throughout the region around the Jordan River, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. 

\s5
\v 4 As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, 
\q1 "The voice of someone calling out in the wilderness,
\q1 'Make ready the way of the Lord,
\q1 Make his paths straight.

\s5
\q1 \v 5 Every valley will be filled, 
\q1 every mountain and hill will be made level,
\q1 the crooked roads will become straight,
\q1 And the rough ways will be made smooth.
\q1 
\v 6 All people will see the salvation of God.'"

\s5
\p 
\v 7 So John said therefore to the large crowds of people who were coming out to be baptized by him, "You offspring of poisonous snakes, who warned you to flee from the wrath that is coming? 

\s5
\v 8 Produce fruits that are worthy of repentance, and do not start saying within yourselves, 'We have Abraham for our father,' because I tell you that God is able to raise up children for Abraham even out of these stones.

\s5
\v 9 Already the ax has been placed against the root of the trees. So every tree that does not produce good fruit is chopped down and thrown into the fire."

\s5
\v 10 Then the people in the crowds asked him, saying, "What then must we do?"  
\v 11 He answered and said to them, "If someone has two tunics, he should give one of them to someone who does not have any and whoever has food should do likewise." 

\s5
\v 12 Then some tax collectors also came to be baptized, and they said to him, "Teacher, what must we do?"  
\v 13 He to them, "Do not collect more money than you are supposed to."

\s5
\v 14 Some soldiers also asked him, saying, "And what about us? What must we do?" He said to them, "Do not take money from anyone by force, and do not accuse anyone falsely. Be content with your wages."

\s5
\p 
\v 15 Now as the people were eagerly expecting the Christ to come, everyone was wondering in their hearts concerning John whether he might be the Christ.  
\v 16 John answered by saying to them all, "As for me, I baptize you with water, but someone is coming who is more powerful than I, and I am not worthy even to untie the strap of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.

\s5
\v 17 His winnowing fork is in his hand to thoroughly clear off his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his storehouse. But he will burn up the chaff with fire that can never be put out."

\s5
\p 
\v 18 With many other exhortations also, he preached good news to the people.  
\v 19 John also rebuked Herod the tetrarch for marrying his brother’s wife, Herodias, and for all the other evil things that Herod had done. 
\v 20 But then Herod did another very evil thing. He had John locked up in prison.

\s5
\p 
\v 21 Now it came about, while all the people were being baptized by John, that Jesus also was baptized. While he was praying, the heavens opened up.  
\v 22 The Holy Spirit came down on him in bodily form like a dove, while a voice came out of heaven, "You are my beloved Son. I am very pleased with you."

\s5
\p 
\v 23 Now Jesus himself, when he began to teach, was about thirty years of age. He was the son (as was supposed) of Joseph, the son of Heli, 
\v 24 the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph,  

\s5
\v 25 the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai,  
\v 26 the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Josech, the son of Joda, 

\s5
\v 27 the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri,  
\v 28 the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmadam, the son of Er,  
\v 29 the son of Joshua, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi,

\s5
\v 30 the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonam, the son of Eliakim,  
\v 31 the son of Melea, the son of Menna, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David,  
\v 32 the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Salmon, the son of Nahshon,

\s5
\v 33 the son of Amminadab, the son of Admin, the son of Arni, the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah,  
\v 34 the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor,  
\v 35 the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Shelah,

\s5
\v 36 the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech,  
\v 37 the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalaleel, the son of Cainan,  
\v 38 the son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.





\s5
\c 4
\p 
\v 1 Then Jesus, being full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan River, and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness 
\v 2 for forty days and was tempted there by the devil. During those days, he did not eat anything, and at the end of that time he was hungry.
 
\s5
\v 3 The devil said to him, "If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread." 
\v 4 Jesus answered him, "It is written, 'Man shall not live on bread alone.'"

\s5
\v 5 Then the devil led him up to a high place, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. 
\v 6 The devil said to him, "I will give to you the authority to rule all of these kingdoms, along with all their splendor. I can do this because they have been given to me to rule over, and I can give them to anyone I want to. 
\v 7 Therefore if you will bow down before me and worship me, all of this will be yours."

\s5
\v 8 But Jesus answered and said to him, "It is written, 'You must worship the Lord your God, and you must serve him only.'"

\s5
\v 9 Next the devil led Jesus to Jerusalem and put him on the very highest point of the temple building, and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here. 
\v 10 For it is written,  
\q1 'He will command his angels to take care of you, to protect you.' 
\v 11 and,  
\q1 'They will lift you up in their hands, 
\q1 so that you will not hit your foot against a stone.'"

\s5
\p 
\v 12 Jesus answering said to him, "It is said, 'You must not test the Lord your God.'" 
\p 
\v 13 When the devil had finished tempting Jesus, he went away and left him until another time.

\s5
\p 
\v 14 Then Jesus returned to Galilee with the power of the Spirit, and news about him spread throughout the entire surrounding region. 
\v 15 He taught in their synagogues, and everyone praised him.

\s5
\p 
\v 16 One day he came to Nazareth, the city where he had been brought up. As was his custom, he entered the synagogue there on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read the scriptures. 
\v 17 The scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him, so he opened the scroll and found the place where it was written,

\s5
\q1 \v 18 "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,
\q1 Because he anointed me to preach good news to the poor.
\q1 He has sent me to proclaim freedom to the captives,
\q1 And recovery of sight to the blind,
\q1 To set free those who are oppressed,
\q1 \v 19 To proclaim the favorable year of the Lord."

\s5
\p 
\v 20 Then he closed the scroll, gave it back to the synagogue attendant, and sat down. The eyes of all the people in the synagogue were fixed on him. 
\v 21 He began to speak to them, "Today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing." 
\v 22 Everyone there witnessed what he said and all of them were amazed at the gracious words which were coming out of his mouth. They were saying, "This is only Joseph’s son, is it not?"

\s5
\v 23 Jesus said to them, "Certainly you will say this proverb to me, 'Doctor, heal yourself. Whatever we heard that you did in Capernaum, do it here in your hometown too.'"
\v 24 He also said, "Truly I say to you, no prophet is accepted in his own country.

\s5
\v 25 But I say to you in truth that there were many widows in Israel during Elijah's time, when the sky was shut up with no rain for three and a half years, when there was a great famine over all the land. 
\v 26 But Elijah was not sent to any of them, but only to a widow living in Zarephath near the city of Sidon. 
\v 27 There were also many lepers in Israel during the time of Elisha the prophet, but none of them were healed except Naaman the Syrian." 

\s5
\v 28 All the people in the synagogue were filled with rage when they heard these things.
\v 29 They got up and forced him out of the city, and led him to the edge of the hill on which their city was built, so that they might throw him over the cliff. 
\v 30 But he walked right through the midst of them and went on his way.

\s5
\p 
\v 31 Then he went down to Capernaum, a city in Galilee. One Sabbath he was teaching the people in the synagogue. 
\v 32 They were astonished at his teaching, because he spoke with authority. 

\s5
\v 33 Now in the synagogue that day there was a man who had the spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice, 
\v 34 "What do we have to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know you who you are! You are the Holy One of God!"
        
\s5
\v 35 Jesus rebuked the demon, saying, "Be quiet and come out of him!" When the demon had thrown the man down in the middle of them, he came out of him without causing him any harm. 
\v 36 All the people were very amazed, and they kept talking about it with one with another. They said, "What kind of words are these? For he commands the unclean spirits with authority and power and they come out?" 
\v 37 So news about him began to spread into every part of the surrounding region.

\s5
\p 
\v 38 Then Jesus left the synagogue and entered into the house of Simon. Now Simon’s mother-in-law was suffering with a high fever, and they pleaded with him on her behalf. 
\v 39 So he stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. Immediately she got up and started serving them.

\s5
\p 
\v 40 When the sun was setting, people brought to Jesus everyone who was sick with various kinds of diseases. He laid his hands on every one of them and healed them. 
\v 41 Demons also came out from many of them, crying out and saying, "You are the Son of God!" Jesus rebuked the demons and would not let them speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.

\s5
\p 
\v 42 When daybreak came, he went out into a solitary place. Crowds of people were looking for him and came to the place where he was. They tried to keep him from going away from them. 
\v 43 But he said to them, "I must also preach the good news about the kingdom of God to many other cities, because this is the reason I was sent here."
\p 
\v 44 Then he continued to preach in the synagogues throughout the province of Judea.

\v 1 Now it happened, while the people were crowding around Jesus and listening to the word of God, that he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret.
\v 2 He saw two boats pulled up by the edge of the lake. The fishermen had gotten out of them and were washing their nets.
\v 3 Jesus got into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, and asked him to put it out in the water a short distance from the land. Then he sat down and taught the people out of the boat.

\s5
\v 4 When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, "Take the boat out into the deeper water and let down your nets for a catch."
\v 5 Simon answered and said, "Master, we worked all night, and caught nothing, but at your word, I will let down the nets."
\v 6 When they had done this, they gathered a very large number of fish, and their nets were breaking.
\v 7 So they motioned to their partners in the other boat that they should come and help them. They came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink.

\s5
\v 8 But Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord."
\v 9 For he was amazed, and all who were with him, at the catch of fish which they had taken.
\v 10 This included James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, "Do not be afraid, because from now on you will catch men."
\v 11 When they had brought their boats to land, they left everything and followed him.

\s5
\p
\v 12 It came about, while he was in one of the cities, that, behold, a man full of leprosy was there. When he saw Jesus, he fell on his face and implored him, saying, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean."
\v 13 Then Jesus reached out his hand and touched him, saying, "I am willing. Be clean." And immediately the leprosy left him.

\s5
\v 14 He instructed him to tell no one, but told him, "Go on your way, and show yourself to the priest and offer a sacrifice for your cleansing, according to what Moses commanded, for a testimony to them."

\s5
\v 15 But the report about him spread even farther, and large crowds of people came together to hear him teach and to be healed of their sicknesses.
\v 16 But he often withdrew into the deserted places and prayed.

\s5
\p
\v 17 It came about on one of those days that he was teaching, and there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting there who had come from many different villages in the regions of Galilee and Judea, and also from the city of Jerusalem. The power of the Lord was with him to heal.

\s5
\v 18 Now some men came, carrying on a mat a man that was paralyzed, and they looked for a way to bring him inside in order to lay him down in front of Jesus.
\v 19 They could not find a way to bring him in because of the crowd, so they went up to the housetop and let the man down through the tiles, on his mat, into the midst of the people, right in front of Jesus.

\s5
\v 20 Seeing their faith, Jesus said, "Man, your sins are forgiven you."
\v 21 The scribes and the Pharisees began to question this, saying, "Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?"

\s5
\v 22 But Jesus, perceiving what they were thinking, answered and said to them, "Why are you questioning this in your hearts?
\v 23 Which is easier to say, 'Your sins are forgiven you' or to say 'Get up and walk?'
\v 24 But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins, I say to you, 'Get up, pick up your mat, and go to your house.'"

\s5
\v 25 Immediately he got up in front of them and picked up the mat he was lying on; then he went back to his house, glorifying God.
\v 26 Everyone was amazed and they glorified God. They were filled with fear, saying, "We have seen extraordinary things today."

\s5
\p
\v 27 After these things happened, Jesus went out from there and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax collecting place. He said to him, "Follow me."
\v 28 So Levi left everything, got up, and followed him.

\s5
\p
\v 29 Then Levi prepared a big banquet for Jesus in his house, and there were many tax collectors there, and other people who were reclining at the table and eating with them.
\v 30 But the Pharisees and their scribes were complaining to his disciples, saying, "Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and other sinful people?"
\v 31 Jesus answered them, "People who are in good health do not need a physician, only people who are sick need one.
\v 32 I did not come to call righteous people to repentance, but to call sinners to repentance."

\s5
\p
\v 33 They said to him, "The disciples of John often fast and pray, and the disciples of the Pharisees do the same. But your disciples eat and drink."
\v 34 Jesus said to them, "Can anyone make the wedding attendants of the bridegroom fast, while the bridegroom is still with them?
\v 35 But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, then in those days they will fast."

\s5
\v 36 Then Jesus also spoke a parable to them. "No man tears a piece of cloth from a new garment and uses it to mend an old garment. If he did that, he would tear the new garment, and the piece of cloth from the new garment would not fit with the cloth of the old garment.

\s5
\v 37 Also, no man puts new wine into old wineskins. If he did that, the new wine would burst the skins, and the wine would be spilled, and the wineskins would be destroyed.
\v 38 But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.
\v 39 No man, after drinking old wine, desires new wine, because he says, 'The old is better.'"





\s5
\c 6
\p
\v 1 Now it happened on a Sabbath that Jesus was going through the grain fields and his disciples were picking the heads of grain, rubbing them between their hands, and eating the grain.
\v 2 But some of the Pharisees said, "Why are you doing something that is not lawful to do on the Sabbath day?"

\s5
\v 3 Jesus, answering them, said, "Have you not even read what David did when he was hungry, he and the men who were with him?
\v 4 He went into the house of God, and took the bread of the presence and ate some of it, and also gave some to the men who were with him to eat, even though it was only lawful for the priests to eat it."
\v 5 Then he said to them, "The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."

\s5
\p
\v 6 It happened on another Sabbath that he went into the synagogue and taught the people there. A man was there whose right hand was shriveled.
\v 7 The scribes and the Pharisees were watching him closely to see whether he would heal someone on the Sabbath, so that they might find a reason to accuse him of doing something wrong.
\v 8 But he knew what they were thinking and he said to the man whose hand was shriveled, "Get up, and stand here in the middle of everyone." So the man got up and stood there.

\s5
\v 9 Jesus said to them, "I ask you, is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save a life or to destroy it?"
\v 10 Then he looked around at them all and said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He did so, and his hand was restored. 
\v 11 But they were filled with anger, and they talked to each other about what they might do to Jesus.

\s5
\p
\v 12 It happened in those days that he went out to the mountain to pray. He continued all night in prayer to God.
\v 13 When it was day, he called his disciples to him, and he chose twelve of them, whom he also named "apostles."

\s5
\v 14 The names of the apostles were Simon (whom he also named Peter) and his brother, Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew,
\v 15 Matthew, Thomas, James, the son of Alphaeus, Simon, who was called the Zealot,
\v 16 Judas, the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.

\s5
\v 17 Then Jesus came down the mountain with them and stood on a level place. A large crowd of his disciples was there, as well as a large number of the people from Judea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon.
\v 18 They had come to listen to him and to be healed of their diseases. People who were troubled with unclean spirits were also healed.
\v 19 Everyone in the crowd kept trying to touch him because power to heal was coming out from him, and he healed them all.

\s5
\p
\v 20 Then he looked at his disciples, and said, "Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.
\v 21 Blessed are you who hunger now, for you will be filled. Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.

\s5
\v 22 Blessed are you when people hate you and when they separate you from their company and reproach you and reject your name as evil, for the Son of Man’s sake.
\v 23 Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, because you will surely have a great reward in heaven, for their ancestors treated the prophets in the same way.

\s5
\v 24 But woe to you who are rich! For you have already received your comfort.
\v 25 Woe to you who are full now! For you will be hungry later. Woe to you who laugh now! For you will mourn and weep later.

\s5
\v 26 Woe to you, when all men speak well of you! For their ancestors treated the false prophets in the same way.

\s5
\p
\v 27 But I say to you who are listening, love your enemies and do good to those who hate you.
\v 28 Bless those who curse you and pray for those who mistreat you.

\s5
\v 29 To him who strikes you on the one cheek, offer him also the other. If someone takes away your coat, do not withhold your tunic either.
\v 30 Give to everyone who asks you. If someone takes away something that belongs to you, do not ask him to give it back to you.

\s5
\v 31 As you want people to do to you, you should do the same to them.
\v 32 If you only love people who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them.
\v 33 If you do good only to people who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same.
\v 34 If you only lend things to people who you expect will give them back to you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, and expect to receive the same amount back again.

\s5
\v 35 But love your enemies and do them good. Lend to them, never worrying about getting anything back, and your reward will be great. You will be sons of the Most High, for he himself is kind toward unthankful and evil people.
\v 36 Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.

\s5
\v 37 Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive others, and you will be forgiven.

\s5
\v 38 Give to others, and it will be given to you. A generous amount--pressed down, shaken together and spilling over--they will pour into your lap. For with whatever standard of measure you use to measure with, that same standard will be used to measure for you."

\s5
\p
\v 39 Then he also told them a parable. "Can a blind person guide another blind person? If he did, they would both fall into a pit, would they not?
\v 40 A disciple is not greater than his teacher, but everyone when he is completely trained will be like his teacher.

\s5
\v 41 And why do you look at the tiny piece of straw that is in your brother’s eye, but you do not notice the log that is in your own eye?
\v 42 How can you say to your brother, 'Brother, let me take out the piece of straw that is in your eye,' when you yourself do not even see the log that is in your own eye? You hypocrite! First take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the piece of straw that is in your brother’s eye.

\s5
\v 43 For there is no good tree that produces rotten fruit, nor is there a rotten tree that produces good fruit.
\v 44 For each tree is known by the kind of fruit it produces. For people do not gather figs from a thornbush, nor do they gather grapes from a briar bush.

\s5
\v 45 The good man from the good treasure of his heart brings out that which is good, and the evil man from the evil treasure of his heart brings out that which is evil. For from the abundance of his heart his mouth speaks.

\s5
\p
\v 46 Why do you call me, 'Lord, Lord,' and yet you do not obey the things that I say?
\v 47 Every person who comes to me and hears my words and obeys them, I will tell you what he is like.
\v 48 He is like a man building a house, who dug down deep in the ground and built the house's foundation on solid rock. When a flood came, the torrent of water flowed against that house, but could not shake it, because it had been well built.

\s5
\v 49 But the person who hears my words and does not obey them, he is like a man who built a house on top of the ground without a foundation. When the torrent of water flowed against that house, it immediately collapsed, and the ruin of that house was complete.




\s5
\c 7
\p
\v 1 After Jesus had finished everything he was saying in the hearing of the people, he entered Capernaum.

\s5
\p
\v 2 A certain centurion's slave, who was precious to him, was very sick and was about to die.
\v 3 But having heard about Jesus, the centurion sent to him elders of the Jews, asking him to come and save his slave from dying.
\v 4 When they had come near to Jesus, they asked him earnestly, saying, "He is worthy that you should do this for him,
\v 5 because he loves our nation, and he is the one who built the synagogue for us."

\s5
\v 6 So Jesus continued on his way with them. But when he was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to say to him, "Lord, do not trouble yourself, because I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof.
\v 7 For this reason I did not even consider myself to be worthy enough to come to you, but just say a word and my servant will be healed.
\v 8 For I also am a man who is placed under authority and I have soldiers under me. I say to this one, 'Go,'  and he goes, and to another one, 'Come,' and he comes, and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."

\s5
\v 9 When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him, and turning to the crowd following him said, "I say to you, not even in Israel have I found anyone with so much faith." 
\v 10 Then those who were sent returned to the house and found the servant healthy.

\s5
\p
\v 11 Some time after that, it happened that Jesus was traveling to a city called Nain. His disciples were going with him, along with a large crowd of people. 
\v 12 As he came near to the city gate, behold, a dead man was being carried out, an only son to his mother. She was a widow, and a sizeable crowd from the city was with her.
\v 13 Seeing her, the Lord was deeply moved with compassion for her and said to her, "Do not cry."
\v 14 Then he came forward and touched the funeral couch, and those carrying it stood still. He said, "Young man, I say to you, arise."
\v 15 The dead man sat up and began to speak. Then  Jesus gave him to his mother.

\s5
\v 16 Then fear overcame all of them. They kept praising God, saying, "A great prophet has been raised among us" and "God has looked upon his people."
\v 17 This news about Jesus spread throughout the whole of Judea and all the neighboring regions.

\s5
\p
\v 18 John's disciples told him about all these things. 
\v 19 Then John called two of his disciples and sent them to the Lord to say, "Are you the Coming One, or is there another person we should be looking for?"
\v 20 When they had come near to Jesus, the men said, "John the Baptist has sent us to you to say, 'Are you the Coming One, or is there another person we should be looking for?'"

\s5
\v 21 In that hour he cured many people from sicknesses and afflictions and from evil spirits, and he granted many blind people the ability to see.
\v 22 Jesus answered and said to them, "After you have gone on your way, report to John what you have seen and heard.  Blind people are receiving sight, lame people are walking, lepers are being cleansed, deaf people are hearing, dead people are being raised back to life, and needy people are being told the good news.
\v 23 The person who does not stop believing in me because of my actions is blessed."

\s5
\p
\v 24 After John's messengers had gone away, Jesus began to say to the crowds about John, "What did you go out into the desert to see, a reed being shaken by the wind?
\v 25 But what did you go out to see, a man dressed in soft clothes? See, people who dress in splendid clothing and live in luxury are in kings' palaces.

\v 26 But what did you go out to see, a prophet? Yes, I say to you, and much more than a prophet.

\s5
\v 27 This is he of whom it is written, 
\q 'See, I am sending my messenger before your face,
\q Who will prepare your way before you.'
\m
\v 28 I say to you, among those born of women, no one is greater than John, yet the least important person in the kingdom of God is greater than he is."

\s5
\v 29 When all the people heard this, including the tax collectors, they declared that God is righteous. They were among those who had been baptized with the baptism of John.
\v 30 But the Pharisees and the experts in Jewish law, who were not baptized by him, rejected God's wisdom for themselves.

\s5
\v 31 "To what then should I compare the people of this generation? What are they like?
\v 32 They are like children playing in the marketplace, who sit and call to one another and say, 'We played a flute for you, and you did not dance. We mourned, and you did not weep.'

\s5
\v 33 For John the Baptist came not eating bread and not drinking wine, and you say, 'He has a demon.'
\v 34 The Son of Man came eating and drinking and you say, 'Look, he is a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!'
\v 35 But wisdom is justified by all of her children."

\s5
\p
\v 36 Now a certain Pharisee was requesting that Jesus eat with him. So after Jesus entered into the Pharisee’s house, he reclined at the table to eat. 
\v 37 Behold, there was a certain woman in the city who was a sinner. She found out that he was reclining in the Pharisee’s house, and she brought an alabaster flask of perfume. 
\v 38 She stood behind him near his feet and wept. Then she began to wet his feet with her tears, and was wiping them with the hairs of her head, kissing his feet, and anointing them with perfume.

\s5
\v 39 When the Pharisee who had invited Jesus saw this, he thought to himself, saying, "If this man were a prophet, then he would know who and what type of woman is touching him that she is a sinner."
\v 40 Jesus responded and said to him, "Simon, I have something to say to you." He said, "Say it, Teacher!"

\s5
\v 41 Jesus said, "There were two debtors to a certain lender. The one owed  five hundred denarii, and the other owed fifty denarii.
\v 42 Since they had no money to pay, he forgave them both. Therefore, which of them will love him more?"
\v 43 Simon answered him and said, "I suppose the one whom he forgave the most." Jesus said to him, "You have judged correctly."

\s5
\v 44 Jesus turned to the woman and said to Simon, "You see this woman. I have entered into your house. You gave me no water for my feet, but she, with her tears, has wet my feet and wiped them with her hair.
\v 45 You did not give me a kiss, but she, from when I first came in, did not stop kissing my feet.

\s5
\v 46 You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with perfume.
\v 47 On account of this, I say to you that she who had many sins and has been forgiven much, has also loved much. But he who is forgiven only a little, loves only a little."


\s5
\v 48 Then he said to her, "Your sins are forgiven."
\v 49 Those reclining together began to say among themselves, "Who is this that even forgives sins?"
\v 50 Then Jesus said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you. Go in peace."





\s5
\c 8
\p
\v 1 It happened soon afterwards that Jesus began traveling around to different cities and villages, preaching and proclaiming the good news about the kingdom of God and the twelve went with him,
\v 2 as well as certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and diseases. They were Mary who was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had been driven out,
\v 3 Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod’s manager, Susanna, and many other women, who provided for them from their own material resources.

\s5
\p
\v 4 Now, when a large crowd of people had gathered together, including people who were coming to him from many different cities, he spoke to them using a parable.
\v 5 "A sower went out to sow some seeds. As he sowed, some of the seeds fell by the wayside and they were trampled underfoot, and the birds of the sky devoured them.
\v 6 Other seeds fell on rocky soil and as soon as they grew into plants, they withered away, because they had no moisture.

\s5
\v 7 Still other seeds fell among thorn plants, and the thorn plants grew up together with the seeds and choked them.
\v 8 But some of the seeds fell on good soil and produced a crop that was a hundred times greater." After Jesus had said these things, he called out, "Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear."

\s5
\p
\v 9 Then his disciples asked him what this parable might mean. 
\v 10 Jesus said to them, "You have been given the privilege of understanding the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but the rest of the people will only be taught with parables, so that 'seeing they will not really see, and hearing they will not really understand.'

\s5
\v 11 Now this is what the parable means. The seed is the word of God.
\v 12 The seeds that fell by the wayside are people who have heard the word, but then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart, so that they may not believe and be saved.
\v 13 Then, the ones that fell on the rocky ground are people who, when they have heard the word, receive it with joy, but they do not have any roots; they only believe for a while, and then during a time of testing they fall away.

\s5
\v 14  The seeds that fell among the thorn plants are people who have heard the word, but as they go on their way, they become choked with the cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and so they bring no fruit to maturity.
\v 15 But the seeds that fell on the good ground, these are people who, with an honest and good heart, after they have heard the word, hold onto it securely and produce fruit with perseverance.

\s5
\p
\v 16 Now, no one, when he has lighted a lamp, covers it with a bowl or puts it under a bed. Rather, he puts it on a lampstand, so that everyone who enters may see the light.
\v 17 For nothing is hidden, that will not be made known, nor anything secret, that will not be known and come into the light.
\v 18 So be careful how you listen, because whoever has, to him will be given more, and whoever has not, from him will be taken away even what he thinks he has."

\s5
\p
\v 19 Then Jesus' mother and brothers came to him, but they could not come near him because of the crowd.
\v 20 And it was told him, "Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, desiring to see you."
\v 21 But Jesus answered and said to them, "My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God, and obey it."

\s5
\p
\v 22 Now it happened on one of those days that Jesus and his disciples entered into a boat, and he said to them, "Let us go over to the other side of the lake." Then they set sail.
\v 23 But as they sailed, Jesus fell asleep, and a storm of very strong winds came up over the lake, and their boat started filling up with water, and they were in serious danger.

\s5
\v 24 Then Jesus' disciples came over to him and woke him up, saying, "Master, master, we are about to die!" He awoke, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water and they ceased, and there was a calm.
\v 25 Then he said to them, "Where is your faith?" Being afraid, they were very amazed, saying one to another, "Who then is this, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?"

\s5
\p
\v 26 They arrived at the region of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee.
\v 27 When Jesus stepped out on the land, a certain man from the city met him, and this man had demons. For a long time he had worn no clothes, and did not live in a house, but rather in the tombs.

\s5
\v 28 When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him. With a loud voice he said, "What do I have to do with you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, do not torment me."
\v 29 For Jesus was commanding the unclean spirit to come out of the man, because many times it had seized him. Even though he was bound with chains and shackles and kept under guard, he would break the bonds apart and be driven by the demon into the wilderness.

\s5
\v 30 Then Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" And he said, "Army," for many demons had entered into him.
\v 31 They kept imploring him that he would not command them to depart into the abyss.

\s5
\v 32 Now a herd of many pigs was there feeding on the hill, and the demons implored him to permit them to enter into the pigs. He permitted them to do that.
\v 33 So the demons came out of the man and entered into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep hill into the lake and were drowned.

\s5
\v 34 When the men who were tending the pigs saw what had happened, they fled and reported it in the city and out in the countryside.
\v 35 So the people who heard about it went out to see what had happened, and they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone out. He was clothed and in his right mind, sitting at the feet of Jesus, and they were afraid.

\s5
\v 36 Then the ones who had seen what happened told the others how the man who was controlled by demons had been saved.
\v 37 All the people of the region of the Gerasenes and the surrounding area asked Jesus to depart from them, for they were gripped with great fear. So he entered into the boat to return.

\s5
\v 38 The man from whom the demons had gone out pleaded with Jesus to let him go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,
\v 39 "Return to your house and recount all the great things God has done for you." The man went on his way, proclaiming throughout the whole city all the great things Jesus had done for him.

\s5
\p
\v 40 As Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him.
\v 41 Behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was one of the leaders of the synagogue. Jairus fell down at Jesus’ feet and implored him to come to his house,
\v 42 for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as he was going, the crowds of people were pressing up against him.

\s5
\p
\v 43 A woman was there who had been bleeding for twelve years and had spent all her money on physicians, but could not be healed by any of them.
\v 44 She came behind Jesus and touched the border of his garment, and immediately her bleeding stopped.

\s5
\v 45 Jesus said, "Who is it that touched me?" When all denied it, Peter said, "Master, the crowds of people are pressing in on you and crowding you."
\v 46 But Jesus said, "Someone did touch me, for I knew that power was going out from me."

\s5
\v 47 When the woman saw that she could not hide what she had done, she came trembling. Falling down before Jesus, she declared in the presence of all the people the reason she had touched him and how she was healed immediately.
\v 48 Then he said to her, "Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace."

\s5
\p
\v 49 While he was still speaking, someone came from the synagogue leader's house, saying, "Your daughter is dead. Do not trouble the teacher."
\v 50 But when Jesus heard that, he answered him, "Do not be afraid. Just believe, and she will be saved."

\s5
\v 51 Then when he came to the house, he did not allow anyone to enter it with him, except Peter, John and James, the father of the girl, and her mother.
\v 52 Now all the people there were mourning and wailing  for her, but he said, "Do not wail. She is not dead, but is only sleeping."
\v 53 But they laughed at him scornfully, knowing that she was dead.

\s5
\v 54 But he, taking the girl by the hand, called out, saying, "Child, arise."
\v 55 Her spirit returned, and she rose up immediately. He commanded that something be given to her to eat.
\v 56 Her parents were astonished, but he commanded them to tell no one what had happened.





\s5
\c 9
\p
\v 1 He called the twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all the demons and to cure diseases.
\v 2 He sent them out to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.

\s5
\v 3 He said to them, "Take nothing for your journey--neither staff, nor wallet, nor bread, nor money--neither take two tunics.
\v 4 Whatever house you enter into, stay there until you leave from that place.

\s5
\v 5 As for those who do not receive you, when you depart from that city, shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony against them."
\v 6 Then they departed and went through the villages, proclaiming the good news and healing people everywhere.

\s5
\p
\v 7 Now Herod, the tetrarch, heard about all that was happening and he was very disturbed, because it was said by some that John the Baptist had risen from the dead,
\v 8 and by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the ancient prophets had risen to life again.
\v 9 Herod said, "I beheaded John, but who is this about whom I hear such things?" And Herod  tried to find a way to see Jesus.

\s5
\p
\v 10 When the ones who had been sent out returned, they told him everything they had done. Taking them with him, he went away by himself to a city called Bethsaida.
\v 11 But the crowds heard about this and followed him, and he welcomed them, and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and he cured those who had need of healing.

\s5
\v 12 The day began to come to an end, and the twelve came to him and said, "Dismiss the crowds that they may go into the surrounding villages and countryside to find lodging and food, because we are here in a deserted place."
\v 13 But he said to them, "You give them something to eat." They said, "We have no more than five loaves of bread and two fish, unless we went and bought food for all this crowd of people."
\v 14 There were about five thousand men there. He said to his disciples, "Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each."

\s5
\v 15 So they did that, and the people all sat down.
\v 16 He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and broke them into pieces, and gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd.
\v 17 They all ate and were satisfied, and the leftover pieces of food were picked up and filled twelve baskets.

\s5
\p
\v 18 It came about that, as he was praying alone, the disciples were with him, and he questioned them, saying, "Who do the multitudes say that I am?"
\v 19 Answering, they said, "John the Baptist, but others say Elijah, and others say that one of the prophets from ancient times has risen again."

\s5
\v 20 He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?" Answering, Peter said, "The Christ from God."
\v 21 But warning them, Jesus instructed them to tell this to no one,
\v 22 saying that the Son of Man must suffer many things, be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, be killed, and be raised back to life on the third day.

\s5
\v 23 He said to them all, "If anyone wants to come after me, he must deny himself, take up his cross daily, and follow me.
\v 24 Whoever would try to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake, he will save it.
\v 25 What does it benefit a man, if he gains the whole world, but loses or forfeits his own self?

\s5
\v 26 Whoever is ashamed of me and my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed when he comes in his own glory, and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.
\v 27 But I say to you truly, there are some of you who are standing here, who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God."

\s5
\p
\v 28 It came about around eight days after Jesus said these words that he took with him Peter, John, and James, and went up into the mountain to pray.
\v 29 As he was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothing became white and dazzling.

\s5
\v 30 Behold, there were two men talking with him! They were Moses and Elijah,
\v 31 who looked glorious. They spoke about his departure, which he was about to fulfill in Jerusalem.

\s5
\v 32 Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep. But when they were fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men who were standing with him.
\v 33 It happened that, as they were going away from Jesus, Peter said to him, "Master, it is good for us to be here and we should make three shelters. Let us make one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah." He did not understand what he was talking about.

\s5
\v 34 Then while he was saying these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them; and they were afraid as they were surrounded by the cloud.
\v 35 A voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This is my chosen Son. Listen to him."
\v 36 When the voice had finished, Jesus was alone. They kept silent, and in those days they told no one any of the things which they had seen.

\s5
\p
\v 37 It happened, on the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, that a great crowd of people met him.
\v 38 Behold, a man from the crowd cried out, saying, "Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child.
\v 39 You see, a spirit takes him, and suddenly he screams, and it causes him to have convulsions with foaming at the mouth. It departs from him with difficulty, injuring him badly when it leaves.
\v 40  I pleaded with your disciples to force it out of him, but they could not."

\s5
\v 41 Jesus answered and said, "You unbelieving and corrupt generation, how long will I have to stay with you and bear with you? Bring your son here."
\v 42 As the boy was still coming, the demon threw him down and shook him violently. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.

\s5
\v 43 They were all amazed at the greatness of God. But while all were still marveling at all the things which he did, he said to his disciples,
\v 44 "Let these words go deeply into your ears, for the Son of Man will be delivered over into the hands of men."
\v 45 But they did not understand what this statement meant, and it was concealed from them, so they could not understand it. They were afraid to ask him about that statement.

\s5
\p
\v 46 Then a dispute started among them about which one of them would be the greatest.
\v 47 But when Jesus realized what they were reasoning in their hearts, he took a little child, and set him by his side,
\v 48 and said to them, "If someone receives a little child like this in my name, he also is receiving me, and if someone receives me, he is also receiving the one who sent me. For the person who is least among all of you is the one who is great."

\s5
\p
\v 49 John answered and said, "Master, we saw someone forcing out demons in your name and we stopped him, because he does not follow with us."
\v 50 But Jesus said to him, "Do not stop him, for he that is not against you is for you."

\s5
\p
\v 51 It happened that, as the days were approaching for him to go up to heaven, he resolutely set his face to go to Jerusalem.
\v 52 He sent messengers ahead of him, and they went and entered into a Samaritan village to prepare for him.
\v 53 But the people there did not receive him, because he had set his face to go to Jerusalem.

\s5
\v 54 Then when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, "Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from heaven and destroy them?"
\v 55 But he turned and rebuked them.
\v 56 Then they went on to another village.

\s5
\p
\v 57 As they were going on their way, someone said to him, "I will follow you wherever you go."
\v 58 Jesus said to him, "Foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."

\s5
\v 59 Then he said to another person, "Follow me." But he said, "Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father."
\v 60 But he said to him, "Leave the dead to bury their own dead, but you go and announce everywhere the kingdom of God."

\s5
\v 61 Another person also said, "I will follow you, Lord, but first allow me to say farewell to them who are at my house."
\v 62 But Jesus said to him, "No one, having put his hand to the plow and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God."





\s5
\c 10
\p
\v 1 Now after these things, the Lord appointed seventy others, and sent them out in pairs ahead of him into every city and place where he himself intended to go.
\v 2 He said to them, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few. Therefore urgently pray to the Lord of the harvest, so that he may send out laborers into his harvest.

\s5
\v 3 Go on your way. See, I send you out as lambs in the midst of wolves.
\v 4 Carry no bag of money, no traveler's bag, nor sandals, and greet no one on the way.

\s5
\v 5 Into whatever house you may enter, first say, 'May peace be on this house.'
\v 6 If a person of peace is there, your peace will rest upon him, but if not, it will return to you.
\v 7 Remain in that same house, eating and drinking what they provide, for the laborer is worthy of his wages. Do not go from house to house.

\s5
\v 8 Whatever city you enter, and they receive you, eat what is set before you,
\v 9 and heal the sick that are there. Say to them, 'The kingdom of God has drawn near to you.'

\s5
\v 10 But into whatever city you enter, and they do not receive you, go out into its streets and say,
\v 11 'Even the dust from your city that clings to our feet we wipe off against you! But know this, that the kingdom of God has drawn near.' 
\v 12 I say to you that on the judgment day it will be more tolerable for Sodom than for that city.

\s5
\v 13 Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! If the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
\v 14 But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you.
\v 15 You, Capernaum, do you think you will be exalted to heaven? No, you will be brought down to hades.

\s5
\v 16 The one who listens to you listens to me, and the one who rejects you rejects me, and the one who rejects me rejects the one who sent me."

\s5
\p
\v 17 The seventy returned with joy, saying, "Lord, even the demons submitted to us in your name."
\v 18 Jesus said to them, "I was watching Satan fall from heaven as lightning.
\v 19 See, I have given you authority to tread on serpents, and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing will in any way hurt you.
\v 20 Nevertheless do not rejoice only in this, that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice even more that your names are engraved in heaven."

\s5
\p
\v 21 At that same time he rejoiced greatly in the Holy Spirit, and said, "I praise you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you concealed these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to those who are untaught, like little children. Yes, Father, for so it was well pleasing in your sight."

\s5
\v 22 "All things have been entrusted to me from my Father, and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, and no one knows who the Father is except the Son, and anyone to whom the Son desires to reveal him."

\s5
\v 23 Turning to the disciples, he said privately, "Blessed are those who see the things that you see.
\v 24 I say to you, that many prophets and kings desired to see the things that you see, and did not see them, and to hear the things that you hear, and did not hear them."

\s5
\p
\v 25 Behold, a certain teacher of the Jewish laws stood up and tested him, saying, "Teacher, what should I do to inherit eternal life?"
\v 26 Jesus said to him, "What is written in the law? How do you read it?"
\v 27 Answering, he said, "You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself."
\v 28 Jesus said to him, "You have answered correctly. Do this, and you will live."

\s5
\v 29 But the teacher, desiring to justify himself, said to Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?"
\v 30 Answering, Jesus said, "A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho. He fell among robbers, who stripped him of his belongings, and beat him, and left him half dead.

\s5
\v 31 By chance a certain priest was going down that way, and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.
\v 32 Similarly a Levite also, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.

\s5
\v 33 But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came to where he was. When he saw him, he was moved with compassion.
\v 34 He approached him and bound up his wounds, pouring oil and wine on them. He set him on his own animal, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.
\v 35 The next day he took out two denarii, and gave them to the host, and said, 'Take care of him and whatever extra you spend, when I return, I will repay you.'

\s5
\v 36 Which of these three, do you think, was a neighbor to him who fell among the robbers?"
\v 37 The teacher said, "The one who showed mercy to him." Jesus said to him, "Go and do the same."

\s5
\p
\v 38 Now as they were traveling along, he entered into a certain village, and a certain woman named Martha welcomed him into her house.
\v 39 She had a sister named Mary, who sat at the Lord’s feet and heard his word.

\s5
\v 40 But Martha was overly busy with preparing to serve a meal. She came up to Jesus, and said, "Lord, do you not care that my sister left me to serve alone? Therefore tell her to help me."
\v 41 But the Lord answered and said to her, "Martha, Martha, you are anxious about many things,
\v 42 but only one thing is necessary. Mary has chosen what is best, which will not be taken away from her."





\s5
\c 11
\p
\v 1 It happened when he finished praying in a certain place, that one of his disciples said, "Lord, teach us to pray just as John taught his disciples." 

\s5
\v 2  Jesus said to them, "When you pray say, 'Father, sanctify your name. Let your kingdom come. 

\s5
\v 3 Give us each day our daily bread.
\v 4  Forgive us our sins, for we ourselves forgive everyone who is in debt to us. Do not lead us into temptation.'"

\s5
\p
\v 5 Jesus said to them, "Which of you will have a friend, and will go to him at midnight, and say to him, 'Friend, lend to me three loaves of bread,
\v 6 since a friend of mine just came in from the road, and I do not have anything to set before him.'
\v 7 Then the one inside, answering, may say, 'Do not bother me. The door is already shut, and my children, along with me, are in bed. I am not able to get up and give bread to you.'
\v 8 I say to you, even if he does not get up and give bread to you because you are his friend, yet because of your shameless persistence, he will get up and give you as many loaves of bread as you need.

\s5
\v 9 I also say to you, ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.
\v 10 For every asking person receives; and the seeking person finds; and to the person who knocks, it will be opened.

\s5
\v 11  Which of you whose son asks his father for a loaf, will give to him a stone instead, or instead of a fish, a snake?
\v 12 Or if he asks for an egg, will you give a scorpion to him?
\v 13 Therefore, if you who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father from heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?"

\s5
\p
\v 14 Later, Jesus was driving out a demon, and it was mute. It happened that when the demon had come out, the mute man spoke. The crowds were astonished!
\v 15 But some of the people said, "By Beelzebul, the ruler of demons, he drives out demons."

\s5
\v 16 Others tested him and sought from him a sign from heaven. 
\v 17 But Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is made desolate, and a house divided against itself falls.

\s5
\v 18 If Satan is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say I cast out demons by Beezelbul.
\v 19 If I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your followers drive them out? Because of this, they will be your judges.
\v 20 But if I drive out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come to you.

\s5
\v 21 When a strong man who is fully armed guards his own house, his goods are safe,
\v 22 but when a stronger man overcomes him, the stronger man takes away the  armor from the man, and plunders the man's possessions.
\v 23  The one who is not with me is against me, and the one who does not gather with me scatters.

\s5
\v 24 When an unclean spirit has gone away from a man, it passes through waterless places and looks for rest. Finding none, it says, 'I will return to my house from which I came.'
\v 25 Having returned, it finds that house swept out and put in order.
\v 26 Then it goes and takes along with it seven other spirits more evil than itself and they all come in to live there. Then the final condition of that man becomes worse than the first."

\s5
\p
\v 27 It happened that, as he said these things, a certain woman raised her voice above the crowd and said to him, "Blessed is the womb that bore you and the breasts that nursed you."
\v 28  But he said, "Rather, blessed are they who hear the word of God and keep it." 

\s5
\p
\v 29  As the crowds were gathering even more people, he began to say, "This generation is an evil generation. It seeks a sign, though no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.
\v 30  For just as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so too the Son of Man will be a sign to this generation.

\s5
\v 31 The Queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and see, someone greater than Solomon is here.

\s5
\v 32  The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation of people and will condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and see, someone greater than Jonah is here.

\s5
\p
\v 33 No one, after lighting a lamp, places it in a dark closet or under a basket, but on a lampstand so that those who enter may have light.
\v 34 Your eye is the lamp of the body. When your eye is good, the whole body is filled with light. But when your eye is bad, your body is full of darkness.
\v 35 Therefore, be careful that the light in you is not darkness.
\v 36 If then, your whole body is full of light, with no part of it in darkness, then your whole body will be like when a lamp shines its brightness on you."

\s5
\p
\v 37 When he had finished speaking, a Pharisee asked him to eat with him at his house, so Jesus went in and reclined.
\v 38 And the Pharisee was surprised that he first did not wash before dinner.

\s5
\v 39 But the Lord said to him, "Now then, you Pharisees clean the outside of cups and bowls, but the inside of you is filled with greed and evil.
\v 40 You senseless men! Did not the one who made the outside also make the inside?
\v 41 Give to the poor what is inside, and then all things will be clean for you.

\s5
\p
\v 42 But woe to you Pharisees, because you tithe the mint and rue and every other garden herb, but you neglect justice and the love of God. It is necessary to act justly and love God, without failing to do the other things also.

\s5
\v 43  Woe to you Pharisees, for you love the front seats in the synagogues and respectful greetings in the market places.
\v 44 Woe to you, for you are like unmarked graves that people walk over without knowing it."

\s5
\p
\v 45 And a certain teacher of the Jewish laws answered him and said, "Teacher, what you say insults us too."
\v 46  Jesus said, "And woe to you, teachers of the law! For you burden men with burdens hard to carry, but you do not even touch those burdens with one of your own fingers.

\s5
\v 47 Woe to you, because you build memorials for the prophets' tombs, and yet it was your ancestors who killed them.
\v 48 So you are witnesses and consent to the works of your ancestors, because they indeed killed the prophets, whose tombs you build memorials for.

\s5
\v 49 For this reason also, God's wisdom said, 'I will send to them prophets and apostles, and they will persecute and kill some of them.'
\v 50 This generation, then, will be held responsible for all the blood of the prophets shed since the world began,
\v 51 from Abel's blood to the blood of Zechariah, who was killed between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I say to you, this generation will be held responsible.

\s5
\v 52 Woe to you teachers of Jewish laws, because you have taken away the key of knowledge; you do not enter in yourselves, and you hinder those who are entering."

\s5
\p
\v 53 After Jesus left there, the scribes and the Pharisees opposed him and argued with him about many things,
\v 54 trying to trap him in his own words.






\s5
\c 12
\p
\v 1 In the meantime, when many thousands of the people were gathered together, so much that they trampled on each other, he began to say to his disciples first of all, "Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.

\s5
\v 2 But there is nothing concealed, that will not be revealed, and nothing hidden, that will not be known.
\v 3 So whatever you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light, and what you have spoken in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed upon the housetops.

\s5
\v 4 I say to you my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body, and after that they have no more that they can do.
\v 5 But I will warn you about whom to fear. Fear the one who, after he has killed, has authority to throw you into hell. Yes, I say to you, fear him.

\s5
\v 6 Are not five sparrows sold for two small coins? Yet not one of them is forgotten in the sight of God.
\v 7 But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Do not fear. You are more valuable than many sparrows.

\s5
\v 8 I say to you, everyone who confesses me before men, the Son of man will also confess before the angels of God,
\v 9 but he who denies me before men will be denied before the angels of God.
\v 10 Everyone who speaks a word against the Son of man, it will be forgiven him, but to him who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven.

\s5
\v 11 When they bring you before the synagogues, the rulers, and the authorities, do not worry about how you will speak in your defense, or what you will say,
\v 12 for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that hour what you should say."

\s5
\p
\v 13 Then someone from the crowd said to him, "Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me."
\v 14 Jesus said to him, "Man, who made me a judge or a mediator over you?"
\v 15 And he said to them, "Watch that you keep yourselves from all greedy desires, because someone’s life does not consist of the abundance of his possessions."

\s5
\v 16 Then Jesus told them a parable, saying, "The field of a rich man yielded abundantly,
\v 17 and he reasoned with himself, saying, 'What will I do, because I do not have a place to store my crops?'
\v 18 He said, 'This is what will I do. I will pull down my barns and build bigger ones, and there I will store all of my grain and other goods.
\v 19 I will say to my soul, "Soul, you have many goods stored up for many years.Rest easy, eat, drink, be merry."' 

\s5
\v 20 But God said to him, 'Foolish man, tonight your soul is required of you, and the things you have prepared, whose will they be?'
\v 21 That is what someone is like who stores up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God."

\s5
\p
\v 22  Jesus said to his disciples, "Therefore I say to you, do not worry about your life—what you will eat, or about your body—what you will wear.
\v 23 For life is more than food, and the body is more than clothes.

\s5
\v 24 Consider the ravens, that they do not sow or reap. They have no storeroom or barn, but God feeds them. How much more valuable you are than the birds!
\v 25 And which of you by being anxious can add a cubit to his lifespan?
\v 26 If then you are not able to do even that smallest thing, why do you worry about the rest?

\s5
\v 27 Consider the lilies—how they grow.They do not labor, neither do they spin. Yet I say to you, even Solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these.
\v 28 If God so clothes the grass in the field, which exists today, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith!

\s5
\v 29 Do not look for what you will eat and what you will drink, and do not be anxious.
\v 30 For all the nations of the world look for these things, and your Father knows that you need these things.

\s5
\v 31 But seek his kingdom, and these things will be added to you.
\v 32 Do not fear, little flock, because your Father is very pleased to give you the kingdom.

\s5
\v 33 Sell your possessions and give to the poor. Make for yourselves purses which will not wear out—treasure in the heavens that does not run out, where no thief comes near, and no moth destroys.
\v 34 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

\s5
\p
\v 35 Let your long clothing be tucked in at your belt, and let your lamps be kept burning,
\v 36 and be like people looking for their master when he returns from the marriage feast, so that when he comes and knocks, they may immediately open the door for him.

\s5
\v 37 Blessed are those servants, whom the master will find watching when he comes. Truly I say to you that he will tuck his long robe in his belt, make them sit down to a meal, and will come and serve them.
\v 38 If the master comes in the second watch of the night, or if even in the third watch, and finds them ready, blessed are those servants.

\s5
\v 39 Moreover know this, that if the master of the house had known the hour the thief was coming, he would not have let his house be broken into.
\v 40 Be ready also, because you do not know the hour when the Son of Man comes."

\s5
\p
\v 41 Peter said, "Lord, are you telling this parable only to us, or also to everyone?"
\v 42 The Lord said, "Who then is the faithful and wise manager whom his lord will set over his other servants to give them their portion of food at the right time?
\v 43 Blessed is that servant, whom his lord finds doing that when he comes.
\v 44 Truly I say to you that he will set him over all his property.

\s5
\v 45 But if that servant says in his heart, 'My lord delays his return,' and begins to beat the male and female servants, and to eat and drink, and to become drunk,
\v 46 the lord of that servant will come in a day when he does not expect, and in an hour that he does not know, and will cut him in pieces and appoint a place for him with the unfaithful.

\s5
\v 47 That servant, having known his lord’s will, and not having prepared or done according to his will, will be beaten with many blows.
\v 48 But he who did not know, and did things worthy of a beating, will be beaten with a few blows. Everyone to whom much is given, much will be required of him, and to whom they entrust much, they will ask even more of him.

\s5
\p
\v 49 I came to cast fire upon the earth, and how I wish that it was already kindled.
\v 50 But I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how I am distressed until it is completed!

\s5
\v 51 Do you think that I came to bring peace on the earth? No, I tell you, but rather division.
\v 52 For from now on there will be five in one house divided--three people against two, or two people against three.
\v 53 They will be divided, father against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter against mother; mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law."

\s5
\p
\v 54 Jesus  was saying to the crowds also, "When you see a cloud rising in the west, immediately you say, 'A shower is coming,' and so it happens.
\v 55 And when a south wind is blowing, you say, 'There will be a scorching heat,' and it happens.
\v 56 Hypocrites, you know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the heavens, but how is it that you do not know how to interpret the present time?

\s5
\v 57 Why do you not judge what is right for yourselves?
\v 58 For when you go with your adversary before the magistrate, on the way make an effort to settle the matter with him so that he does not drag you to the judge, and so that the judge does not deliver you to the officer, and the officer does not throw you into prison.
\v 59 I say to you, you will never come out from there until you have paid the very last bit of money." 





\s5
\c 13
\p
\v 1 At that time, some people there told him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate mixed with their own sacrifices.
\v 2 Jesus answered and said to them, "Do you think that these Galileans were more sinful than all the other Galileans because they suffered in this way?  
\v 3 No, I tell you. But if you do not repent, all of you will perish in the same way.

\s5
\v 4 Or those eighteen people in Siloam on whom a tower fell and killed them, do you think they were worse sinners than other men in Jerusalem?
\v 5 No, I say. But if you do not repent, all of you will also perish."

\s5
\p
\v 6 Jesus told this parable, "Someone had a fig tree planted in his vineyard and he came and looked for fruit on it but found none.
\v 7 The man said to the gardener, 'Look, for three years I came and tried to find fruit on this fig tree and found none. Cut it down. Why let it waste the ground?'

\s5
\v 8 The gardener answered and said, 'Leave it alone this year while I dig around it and put manure on it.
\v 9 If it bears fruit next year, good; but if it does not, cut it down!'"

\s5
\p
\v 10 Now Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues during the Sabbath.
\v 11 Behold, a woman was there who for eighteen years had an evil spirit of weakness, and she was bent over and not able to completely stand up.

\s5
\v 12 When Jesus saw her, he called to her and said, "Be free of your weakness." 
\v 13 He placed his hands on her, and immediately she was straightened up and she glorified God.
\v 14 But the synagogue ruler was indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath. So the ruler answered and said to the crowd, "There are six days in which it is necessary to work. Come and be healed then, not on the Sabbath day."

\s5
\v 15 The Lord answered him and said, "Hypocrites! Does not each of you untie your donkey or cow from its stall and lead it to drink on the Sabbath?
\v 16 So too this daughter of Abraham, whom Satan bound for eighteen long years, should her bonds not be untied on the Sabbath day?"

\s5
\v 17 As he said these things, all those who opposed him were ashamed, but the whole crowd was rejoicing over all the glorious things he did.

\s5
\p
\v 18 Then Jesus said, "What is the kingdom of God like, and what can I compare it to?
\v 19 It is like a mustard seed which a man took and threw into his garden, and it grew into a big tree, and the birds of heaven built their nests in its branches."

\s5
\p
\v 20 Again he said, "To what can I compare the kingdom of God?
\v 21 It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed with three measures of flour until it rose."

\s5
\p
\v 22 Jesus visited each town and village on the way to Jerusalem and taught them.
\v 23 Someone said to him, "Lord, are only a few people to be saved?" So he said to them,
\v 24 "Struggle to enter through the narrow door, because many will try and will not be able to enter.

\s5
\v 25 Once the owner of the house gets up and locks the door, then you will stand outside and pound the door and say, ‘Lord, Lord, let us in.’ And he will answer and say to you, 'I do not know you or where you are from.'
\v 26 Then you will say, 'We ate and drank in front of you and you taught in our streets.'
\v 27 But he will reply, 'I say to you, I do not know where you are from. Get away from me, you evildoers!'

\s5
\v 28 There will be crying and the grinding of teeth when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and all the prophets in God's kingdom, but you—you were thrown outside.
\v 29 They will arrive from the east, west,north, and south, and relax at the dinner table in the kingdom of God. 
\v 30 And know this, the last are the first, and the first will be last."

\s5
\p
\v 31 Shortly after, some Pharisees came and said to him, "Go and leave here because Herod wants to kill you."
\v 32 Jesus said, "Go and tell that fox, 'Look, I cast out demons and perform healings today and tomorrow, and the third day I will reach my goal.'
\v 33 In any case, it is necessary for me to continue on today, tomorrow, and the following day, since it is not acceptable to kill a prophet away from Jerusalem.

\s5
\v 34 Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those sent to you. How often I desired to gather your children the way a hen gathers her brood under her wings, but you did not desire this.
\v 35 See, your house is abandoned. I say to you, you will not see me until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'”  





\s5
\c 14
\p
\v 1 It happened one Sabbath, when he went into the house of one of the leaders of the Pharisees to eat bread, that they were watching him closely.
\v 2 Behold, there in front of him was a man who was suffering from edema.
\v 3 Jesus asked the experts in the Jewish law and the Pharisees, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath, or not?"

\s5
\v 4 But they kept silent. So Jesus took hold of him, healed him, and sent him away.
\v 5 He said to them, "Which of you who has a son or an ox that falls into a well on the Sabbath day will not immediately pull him out?"
\v 6 They were not able to give an answer to these things.

\s5
\p
\v 7 When Jesus noticed how those who were invited chose the seats of honor, he spoke a parable, saying to them,
\v 8 "When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast, do not sit down in the place of honor, because someone may have been invited who is more honored than you.
\v 9 When the person who invited both of you arrives, he will say to you, 'Give this other person your place,' and then in shame you will proceed to take the lowest place.

\s5
\v 10 But when you are invited, go and sit down in the lowest place, so that when the one who has invited you comes, he may say to you, 'Friend, go up higher.' Then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at the table with you.
\v 11 For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted."

\s5
\p
\v 12 Jesus also said to the man who had invited him, "When you give a luncheon or a dinner, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or your rich neighbors, as they may also invite you in return, and you will be repaid.

\s5
\v 13 But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind,
\v 14 and you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you. For you will be repaid in the resurrection of the just."

\s5
\p
\v 15 When one of them who sat at the table with Jesus heard these things, he said to him, "Blessed is he who will eat bread in the kingdom of God!"
\v 16 But Jesus said to him, "A certain man prepared a large dinner and invited many.
\v 17 When the dinner was prepared, he sent his servant to say to those who were invited, 'Come, because everything is now ready.'

\s5
\v 18 They all alike began to make excuses. The first said to him, 'I have bought a field, and I must go out and see it. Please excuse me.'
\v 19 And another said, 'I have bought five pairs of oxen, and I am going to try them out. Please excuse me.'
\v 20 And another man said, 'I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.'

\s5
\v 21 The servant came and told his master these things. Then the master of the house became angry and said to his servant, 'Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in here the poor, the crippled, the blind, and the lame.'
\v 22 The servant said, 'Master, what you commanded has been done, and yet there is still room.'

\s5
\v 23 The master said to the servant, 'Go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.
\v 24 For I say to you, none of those men who were first invited will taste my dinner.'"

\s5
\p
\v 25 Now large crowds were going with him, and he turned and said to them,
\v 26 "If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father, mother, wife, children, brothers and sisters--yes, and his own life also--he cannot be my disciple.
\v 27 Whoever does not carry his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple.

\s5
\v 28 For which of you, who desires to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost to calculate if he has what he needs to complete it?
\v 29 Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, all who see it will begin to mock him,
\v 30 saying, 'This man began to build and was not able to finish.'

\s5
\v 31 Or what king, as he goes to encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and take advice about whether he is able with ten thousand men to fight the other king who comes against him with twenty thousand men?
\v 32 And if not, while the other army is still far away, he sends an ambassador and asks for conditions of peace.
\v 33 So therefore, any one of you who does not give up all that he has cannot be my disciple.

\s5
\v 34 Salt is good, but if the salt has lost its taste, how can it be made salty again?
\v 35 It is of no use for the soil or even for the manure pile. It is thrown away. He who has ears to hear, let him hear."





\s5
\c 15
\p
\v 1 Now all the tax collectors and other sinners were coming to Jesus to listen to him.
\v 2 Both the Pharisees and the scribes grumbled to each other, saying, "This man welcomes sinners, and even eats with them."

\s5
\p
\v 3 Jesus spoke this parable to them, saying,
\v 4 "Which one of you, if he has a hundred sheep and then loses one of them, will not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after the lost one until he finds it?
\v 5 Then when he has found it, he lays it across his shoulders and rejoices.

\s5
\v 6 When he comes to the house, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found my lost sheep.'
\v 7 I say to you that even so, there will be joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, more than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent.

\s5
\p
\v 8 Or what woman who has ten silver coins, if she were to lose one coin, would not light a lamp, sweep the house, and seek diligently until she has found it?
\v 9 And when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin which I lost.'
\v 10 Even so, I say to you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents."

\s5
\p
\v 11 Then Jesus said, "A certain man had two sons,
\v 12 and the younger of them said to his father, 'Father, give me now the property I am due to inherit.' So he divided his wealth between them.

\s5
\v 13 Not many days later, the younger son packed up and journeyed into a far country, and there he wasted his money with wildly extravagant living.
\v 14 Now when he had spent it all, a great famine happened in that country, and he began to be in need.

\s5
\v 15 He went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed pigs.
\v 16 And he would gladly have eaten the bean pods that the pigs ate because no one gave him anything to eat.

\s5
\v 17 But when the young son came to himself, he said, 'How many of my father's hired servants have more than enough food, and I am here, dying from hunger!
\v 18 I will leave here and go to my father, and will say to him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight.
\v 19 I am no more worthy to be called your son; make me as one of your hired servants."'

\s5
\v 20 So the young son left and came toward his father. While he was still far away, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and ran, and hugged and kissed him.
\v 21 The son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight. I am no  worthy to be called your son.'

\s5
\v 22 The father said to his servants, 'Bring quickly the best robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and sandals on his feet.
\v 23 Then bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let us eat and have a feast.
\v 24 For my son was dead, and is now alive. He was lost, and is now found.' And they began to feast.

\s5
\v 25 Now his elder son was out in the field. As he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing.
\v 26 He called to one of the servants and asked what these things might be.
\v 27 The servant said to him, 'Your brother has come home and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has returned safely.'

\s5
\v 28 The elder son was angry, and would not go in, and his father came out, and begged him.
\v 29 But the elder son answered and said to his father, 'Look, these many years I slaved for you, and I never broke a rule of yours, and yet you never gave me a young goat that I might have a feast with my friends,
\v 30 but when your son came, who has devoured your living with prostitutes, you killed for him the fattened calf.'

\s5
\v 31 The father said to him, 'Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours.
\v 32 But it was  proper for us to feast and be happy, for this brother of yours was dead, and is now alive;  he was lost, and has now been found.'"





\s5
\c 16
\p
\v 1 Jesus also said to the disciples, "There was a certain rich man who had a manager, and it was reported to him that this manager was squandering his possessions.
\v 2 So the rich man called him and said to him, 'What is this that I hear about you? Give an account of your management, for you can no longer be manager.'

\s5
\v 3 The manager said to himself, 'What should I do, since my master is taking away my management job? I don't have strength to dig, and I am ashamed to beg.
\v 4 I know what I will do, so that when I am removed from my management job, people will welcome me into their houses.'

\s5
\v 5 Then the manager called for each one of his master's debtors, and he asked the first one, 'How much do you owe to my master?'
\v 6 He said, 'A hundred measures of olive oil.' And he said to him, 'Take your bill, sit down quickly, and write fifty.'
\v 7 Then the manager said to another, 'And how much do you owe?' He said, 'A hundred measures of wheat.' He said to him, 'Take your bill, and write eighty.'

\s5
\v 8 The master then commended the unrighteous manager because he had acted shrewdly, since the sons of this world are more shrewd concerning their own people than the sons of the light are.
\v 9 I say to you, make friends for yourselves by means of worldly wealth, so that when it is gone, they may welcome you into the eternal dwellings.

\s5
\v 10 He who is faithful in very little is also faithful in much, and he who is unrighteous in very little is also unrighteous in much.
\v 11 Therefore, if you have not been faithful in using worldly wealth, who will trust you with true wealth?
\v 12 Likewise, if you have not been faithful in that which belongs to another person, who will give you that which is your own?

\s5
\v 13 No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth."

\s5
\p
\v 14 Now the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all these things, and they ridiculed him.
\v 15 And he said to them, "You justify yourselves in the sight of men, but God knows your hearts. That which is exalted among men is detestable in the sight of God.

\s5
\v 16 The law and the prophets were in effect until John came. From that time on, the gospel of the kingdom of God is preached, and everyone tries to force their way into it.
\v 17 But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one stroke of a letter of the law to become invalid.

\s5
\p
\v 18 Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and he who marries one who is divorced from her husband commits adultery.

\s5
\p
\v 19 Now there was a certain rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and was enjoying every day his great wealth.
\v 20 A certain beggar named Lazarus was laid at his gate, covered with sores,
\v 21 and he yearned to be fed with what fell from the rich man’s table—and besides that, the dogs came and licked his sores.

\s5
\v 22 It came about that the beggar died and was carried away by the angels to Abraham’s side. The rich man also died and was buried,
\v 23 and in hades, being in torment, he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham far away and Lazarus against his chest.

\s5
\v 24 And he cried out and said, 'Father Abraham, have mercy on me and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am in anguish in this flame.'

\s5
\v 25 But Abraham said, 'Child, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, and Lazarus in like manner evil things. But now he is comforted here, and you are in agony.
\v 26 And besides all this, a great chasm has been firmly placed, so that those who want to cross over from here to you will not be able to, and no one will be able to come across from there to us.'

\s5
\v 27 The rich man said, 'I beg you, Father Abraham, that you would send him to my father’s house—
\v 28 for I have five brothers—in order that he may warn them, for fear that they also come into this place of torment.'

\s5
\v 29 But Abraham said, 'They have Moses and the prophets; let them listen to them.'
\v 30 The rich man replied, 'No, Father Abraham, but if someone would go to them from the dead, they will repent.'
\v 31 But Abraham said to him, 'If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded if someone rises from the dead.'"

\s5
\c 17
\p
\v 1 Jesus said to his disciples, "It is certain that things that cause sin will come, but woe to him through whom they come!
\v 2 It would be better for him if a millstone were put around his neck and he were thrown into the sea, than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble.

\s5
\v 3  Watch yourselves. If your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him.
\v 4 If he sins against you seven times in the day, and seven times returns to you, saying, 'I repent,' you must forgive him!"

\s5
\p
\v 5 The apostles said to the Lord, "Increase our faith."
\v 6 The Lord said, "If you had faith as a mustard seed, you would say to this sycamore tree, 'Be uprooted, and be planted in the sea,' and it would obey you.

\s5
\v 7 But which of you, who has a servant plowing or keeping sheep, will say to him when he has come in from the field, 'Come immediately and sit down to eat.'
\v 8 Will he not say to him, 'Prepare something for me to eat, and put a belt around your clothes and serve me until I have finished eating and drinking. Then afterward you will eat and drink'?

\s5
\v 9 He does not thank the servant because he did the things that were commanded, does he?
\v 10 Even so you also, when you have done everything that you are commanded, should say, 'We are unworthy servants. We have only done what we ought to do.'"

\s5
\p
\v 11 It came about that as they were on the way to Jerusalem, he was traveling through the borderlands of Samaria and Galilee.
\v 12 As he entered into a certain village, there he was met by ten men who were lepers. They stood far away from him
\v 13 and they lifted up their voices, saying, "Jesus, Master, have mercy on us."

\s5
\v 14 When he saw them, he said to them, "Go and show yourselves to the priests." And it came about that, as they went, they were cleansed.
\v 15 When one of them saw that he was healed, he turned back, with a loud voice glorifying God.
\v 16 He bowed down at Jesus' feet, giving him thanks. He was a Samaritan.

\s5
\v 17 Jesus answering, said, "Were not the ten cleansed? Where are the nine?
\v 18 Were there no others who returned to give glory to God, except this foreigner?"
\v 19 He said to him, "Arise, and go. Your faith has healed you."

\s5
\p
\v 20 Being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, Jesus answered them and said, "The kingdom of God is not something that can be observed.
\v 21 Neither will they say, 'Look here!' or, 'Look there!' because the kingdom of God is among you."

\s5
\p
\v 22 Jesus said to the disciples, "The days will come when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it.
\v 23 They will say to you, 'Look, there! Look, here!' But do not go looking, nor follow after them,
\v 24 for as the lightning appears when it flashes from one part of the sky to another part of the sky, so will the Son of Man be in his day.

\s5
\v 25 But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.
\v 26 As it happened in the days of Noah, even so will it also happen in the days of the Son of Man.
\v 27 They ate, they drank, they married, and they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark—and the flood came and destroyed them all.

\s5
\v 28 Likewise even as it happened in the days of Lot, they ate, drank, bought, sold, planted, and they built.
\v 29 But in the day that Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire and sulfur from heaven and destroyed them all.

\s5
\v 30 After the same manner it will be in the day that the Son of Man is revealed.
\v 31 In that day, do not let him who is on the housetop go down to get his goods out of the house. And do not let him who is in the field return.

\s5
\v 32 Remember Lot’s wife.
\v 33 Whoever seeks to gain his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life will save it.

\s5
\v 34 I tell you, in that night there will be two men in one bed. One will be taken, and the other will be left.
\v 35 There will be two women grinding together. One will be taken, and the other will be left."
\v 36 \f + \ft Luke 17:36 the best ancient copies omit, vs. 36 \fqa There will be two in the field; one will be taken and the other left.  \f*
    
\s5
\v 37 They asked him, "Where, Lord?" And he said to them, "Where there is a body, there will the vultures also be gathered together."





\s5
\c 18
\p
\v 1 Then he spoke a parable to them about how they should always pray, and not become discouraged,
\v 2 saying, "There was in a certain city a certain judge who did not fear God and did not respect people.

\s5
\v 3 Now there was a widow in that city, and she came often to him, saying, 'Help me get justice against my opponent.'
\v 4 For a long time he was not willing to help her, but after awhile he said to himself, 'Though I do not fear God or respect man,
\v 5 yet because this widow causes me trouble, I will help her get justice, so that she does not wear me out by her constant coming.'"

\s5
\v 6 Then the Lord said, "Listen to what the unjust judge says.
\v 7 Now will not God also bring justice to his chosen ones who cry out to him day and night? Will he not be patient with them?
\v 8 I say to you that he will bring justice to them speedily. But when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?"

\s5
\p
\v 9 Then he also spoke this parable to some who were persuaded in themselves that they were righteous and who despised other people, 
\v 10 "Two men went up into the temple to pray—the one was a Pharisee and the other was a tax collector.

\s5
\v 11 The Pharisee stood and prayed these things about himself, 'God, I thank you that I am not like other people who are robbers, unrighteous people, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.
\v 12 I fast two times every week. I give tithes of all that I get.'

\s5
\v 13 But the tax collector, standing at a distance, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but hit his breast, saying, 'God, be merciful to me, a sinner.'
\v 14 I say to you, this man went back down to his house justified rather than the other, because everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but everyone who humbles himself will be exalted."

\s5
\p
\v 15 The people were also bringing to him their infants, so that he might touch them, but when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.
\v 16 But Jesus called them to him, saying, "Permit the little children to come to me, and do not forbid them. For the kingdom of God belongs to such ones.
\v 17 Truly I say to you, whoever will not receive the kingdom of God as a child will definitely not enter it."

\s5
\p
\v 18 A certain ruler asked him, saying, "Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
\v 19 Jesus said to him, "Why do you call me good? No one is good, except God alone.
\v 20 You know the commandments—do not commit adultery, do not kill, do not steal, do not testify falsely, honor your father and mother."
\v 21 The ruler said, "All these things I have obeyed from the time I was a youth."

\s5
\v 22 When Jesus heard that, he said to him, "One thing you still lack. You must sell all that you have and distribute it to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven—and come, follow me."
\v 23 But when the rich man heard these things, he became extremely sad, for he was very rich.

\s5
\v 24 Then Jesus, seeing him, became very sad and said, "How difficult it is for those who are rich to enter the kingdom of God!
\v 25 For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye, than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God."

\s5
\v 26 Those hearing it said, "Then who can be saved?"
\v 27 Jesus answered, "The things which are impossible with people are possible with God."

\s5
\v 28 Peter said, "Well, we have left everything that is our own and have followed you."
\v 29 Jesus then said to them, "Truly, I say to you that there is no one who has left house, or wife, or brothers, or parents, or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,
\v 30 who will not receive much more in this world, and in the world to come, eternal life."

\s5
\p
\v 31 After he gathered the twelve to himself, he said to them, "See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all the things that have been written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be accomplished.
\v 32 For he will be given over to the Gentiles, and will be mocked, and shamefully treated, and spit upon.
\v 33 After whipping him, they will kill him and on the third day he will rise again."

\s5
\v 34 They understood none of these things, and this word was hidden from them, and they did not understand the things that were said.

\s5
\p
\v 35 It came about that, as Jesus drew near to Jericho, a certain blind man was sitting by the road begging,
\v 36 and hearing a crowd going by, he asked what was happening.
\v 37 They told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.

\s5
\v 38 So the blind man cried out, saying, "Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me."
\v 39 The ones who were walking ahead rebuked the blind man, telling him to be quiet. But he cried out all the more, "Son of David, have mercy on me."

\s5
\v 40 Jesus stood still and commanded that the man be brought to him. Then when the blind man was near, Jesus asked him,
\v 41 "What do you want me to do for you?" He said, "Lord, I want to receive my sight."

\s5
\v 42 Jesus said to him, "Receive your sight. Your faith has healed you."
\v 43 Immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God. Seeing this, all the people gave praise to God.








\s5
\c 19
\p
\v 1 Jesus entered and was passing through Jericho.
\v 2 Behold, there was a man there named Zacchaeus. He was a chief tax collector and was rich.

\s5
\v 3 He was trying to see who Jesus was, but could not see over the crowd, because he was small in height.
\v 4 So he ran on ahead of the people and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, because Jesus was about to pass that way.

\s5
\v 5 When Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, "Zacchaeus, come down quickly, for today I must stay at your house."
\v 6 So he hurried and came down and welcomed him joyfully.
\v 7 When everyone saw this, they all complained, saying, "He has gone in to visit a man who is a sinner."

\s5
\v 8 Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, "Look, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor, and if I have cheated anyone of anything, I will restore four times the amount."
\v 9 Jesus said to him, "Today salvation has come to this house, because he too is a son of Abraham.
\v 10 For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the people who are lost."

\s5
\p
\v 11 As they heard these things, he continued speaking and told a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem, and they thought that the kingdom of God was about to appear immediately.
\v 12 He said therefore, "A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and then to return.

\s5
\v 13 He called ten of his servants, and gave them ten minas, and said to them, 'Conduct business until I come back.'
\v 14 But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation of ambassadors after him, saying, 'We will not have this man rule over us.'
\v 15 It happened when he came back again, having received the kingdom, he commanded the servants to whom he had given the money to be called to him, that he might know what profit they had made by doing business.

\s5
\v 16 The first came before him, saying, 'Lord, your mina has made ten minas more.'
\v 17 The nobleman said to him, 'Well done, good servant. Because you were faithful in very little, you will have authority over ten cities.'

\s5
\v 18 The second came, saying, 'Your mina, lord, has made five minas.'
\v 19 The nobleman said to him, 'You take charge over five cities.'

\s5
\v 20 And another came, saying, 'Lord, here is your mina, which I kept safely in a cloth,
\v 21 for I was afraid of you, because you are a severe man. You take up that which you did not lay down, and reap that which you did not sow.'

\s5
\v 22 The nobleman said to him, 'By your own words I will judge you, you wicked servant. You knew that I am a severe man, taking up that which I did not lay down, and reaping that which I did not sow.
\v 23 Then why did you not put my money in the bank, so that when I returned I would have collected it with interest?'

\s5
\v 24 The nobleman said to them that stood by, 'Take away from him the mina, and give it to him that has the ten minas.'
\v 25 They said to him, 'Lord, he has ten minas.'

\s5
\v 26 'I say to you, that everyone who has will be given more, but from him that has not, even that which he has will be taken away.
\v 27 But these enemies of mine, those who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and kill them before me.'"

\s5
\p
\v 28 When he had said these things, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.

\s5
\p
\v 29 It came about that when he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount that is called Olivet, he sent two of the disciples,
\v 30 saying, "Go into the next village. As you enter, you will find a colt that has never been ridden. Untie it and bring it to me.
 \v 31 If any one asks you, 'Why are you untying it?' say, 'The Lord has need of it.'"

\s5
\v 32 Those who were sent went and found the colt just as Jesus had told them.
\v 33 As they were untying the colt, the owners said to them, "Why are you untying the colt?"
\v 34 They said, "The Lord has need of it."
\v 35 They brought it to Jesus, and they threw their garments upon the colt and set Jesus on it.
\v 36 As he went, they spread their garments on the road.

\s5
\v 37 As he was now drawing near to where the Mount of Olives descends, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works which they had seen,
\v 38 saying, "Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!"

\s5
\v 39 Some of the Pharisees in the multitude said to him, "Teacher, rebuke your disciples."
\v 40 Jesus answered and said, "I tell you, if these were silent, the stones would cry out."

\s5
\p
\v 41 When Jesus drew near to the city, he wept over it,
\v 42 saying, "If only you had known in this day, even you, the things which bring you peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes.

\s5
\v 43 For the days will come upon you, when your enemies will build a barricade around you, and surround you, and press in on you from every side.
\v 44 They will strike you down to the ground and your children with you. They will not leave one stone upon another, because you did not recognize it when God was trying to save you."

\s5
\p
\v 45 Jesus entered the temple and began to cast out those who were selling,
\v 46 saying to them, "It is written, 'My house will be a house of prayer,' but you have made it a den of robbers."

\s5
\p
\v 47 So Jesus was teaching daily in the temple. The chief priests and the scribes and the leaders of the people wanted to kill him,
\v 48 but they could not find a way to do it, because all the people were listening to him intently.






\s5
\c 20
\p
\v 1 It came about one day, as Jesus was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes came to him with the elders.
\v 2 They spoke, saying to him, "Tell us by what authority you do these things? Or who is he that gave you this authority?"

\s5
\v 3 He answered and said to them, "I also will ask you a question. Tell me about
\v 4 the baptism of John. Was it from heaven or from men?"

\s5
\v 5 They reasoned with themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say, 'Then why did you not believe him?'
\v 6 But if we say, 'From men,' all the people will stone us, for they are persuaded that John was a prophet."

\s5
\v 7 So they answered that they did not know where it came from.
\v 8 Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things."

\s5
\p
\v 9 He told the people this parable, "A man planted a vineyard, rented it out to vine growers, and went into another country for a long time.
\v 10 At the appointed time he sent a servant to the vine growers, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard. But the vine growers beat him, and sent him away empty-handed.

\s5
\v 11 He then sent yet another servant and they also beat him, treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty-handed.
\v 12 He also sent yet a third and they also wounded him, and threw him out.

\s5
\v 13 So the lord of the vineyard said, 'What will I do? I will send my beloved son. Maybe they will respect him.'
\v 14 But when the vine growers saw him, they discussed among themselves, saying, 'This is the heir. Let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.'

\s5
\v 15 They threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What then will the lord of the vineyard do to them?
\v 16 He will come and destroy these vine growers, and will give the vineyard to others." And when they heard it, they said, "God forbid!"

\s5
\v 17 But Jesus looked at them, and said, "What does this scripture  mean?
 \q 'The stone which the builders rejected, has been made the cornerstone'?
\m
\v 18 Every one that falls on that stone will be broken to pieces. But on whomever it falls, it will crush."

\s5
\p
\v 19 So the scribes and the chief priests sought to lay hands on him in that very hour, for they knew that he had spoken this parable against them. But they were afraid of the people.
\v 20 Watching him carefully, they sent out spies who pretended to be righteous, that they might find fault with his speech, so as to deliver him up to the rule and to the authority of the governor.

\s5
\v 21 They asked him, saying, "Teacher, we know that you say and teach rightly, and are not influenced by anyone, but  you teach the truth about the way of God.
\v 22 Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?"

\s5
\v 23 But Jesus understood their craftiness, and said to them,
\v 24 "Show me a denarius. Whose image and superscription is on it?" They said, "Caesar’s."

\s5
\v 25 He said to them, "Then give to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God, the things that are God’s."
\v 26 The scribes and chief priests were not able to criticize what he had said in front of the people. They marveled at his answer and they said nothing.

\s5
\p
\v 27 When some of the Sadducees came to him, the ones who say that there is no resurrection,
\v 28 they asked him, saying, "Teacher, Moses wrote to us that if a man’s brother dies, having a wife, and being childless, the man should take the brother's wife, and have a child for his brother.

\s5
\v 29 There were seven brothers and the first took a wife, and died childless,
\v 30 and the second as well. 
\v 31 The third took her, and likewise the seven also left no children, and died.
\v 32 Afterward the woman also died.
\v 33 In the resurrection then, whose wife will she be? For the seven had her as their wife."

\s5
\v 34 Jesus said to them, "The sons of this world marry, and are given in marriage.
\v 35 But they who are judged to be worthy to receive the resurrection from the dead and to enter eternity neither marry, nor are given in marriage.
\v 36 Neither can they die anymore, for they are equal to the angels and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.

\s5
\v 37 But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed, in the place concerning the bush, where he calls the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.
\v 38 Now he is not the God of the dead, but of the living, because all live to him."

\s5
\v 39 Some of the scribes answered, "Teacher, you have answered well."
\v 40 For they did not dare ask him any more questions.

\s5
\p
\v 41 Jesus said to them, "How do they say that the Christ is David’s son?
\v 42 For David himself says in the book of Psalms, 
\q The Lord said to my Lord,
\q 'Sit at my right hand,
\q
\v 43 until I make your enemies your footstool.'
\m
\v 44 David therefore calls the Christ 'Lord', so how is he David's son?"

\s5
\p
\v 45 In the hearing of all the people he said to his disciples,
\v 46 "Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk in long robes, and love special greetings in the marketplaces, and chief seats in the synagogues, and chief places at feasts.
\v 47 They also devour widows’ houses, and pretentiously make long prayers. These will receive greater condemnation."



    


\s5
\c 21
\p
\v 1 Jesus looked up and saw the rich men who were putting their gifts into the treasury.
\v 2 He saw a certain poor widow putting in two mites.
\v 3 So he said, "Truly I say to you, this poor widow put in more than all of them.
\v 4 All of these gave gifts out of their abundance. But this widow, out of her poverty, put in all of the money which she had to live on."
\s5
\p
\v 5 As some spoke of the temple, how it was decorated with beautiful stones and offerings, he said,
\v 6 "As for these things which you see, the days will come when not one stone will be left on another which will not be torn down."

\s5
\v 7 So they asked him, saying, "Teacher, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign when these things are about to happen?"
\v 8 Jesus answered, "Be careful that you are not deceived. For many will come in my name, saying, 'I am he,' and, 'The time is near.'  Do not go after them.
\v 9 When you hear of wars and riots, do not be terrified, for these things must happen first, but the end will not happen immediately."

\s5
\p
\v 10 Then he said to them, "Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
\v 11 There will be great earthquakes, and in various places famines and plagues. There will be terrifying events and great signs from heaven.

\s5
\v 12 But before all of these things, they will lay their hands on you and will persecute you, delivering you over to the synagogues and prisons, bringing you before kings and governors because of my name.
\v 13 It will lead to an opportunity for your testimony.

\s5
\v 14 Therefore resolve in your hearts not to prepare your defense ahead of time,
\v 15 for I will give you words and wisdom, which all your adversaries will not be able to resist or contradict.

\s5
\v 16 But you will be delivered up also by parents, brothers, relatives and friends, and they will put some of you to death.
\v 17 You will be hated by everyone because of my name.
\v 18 But not a hair of your head will perish.
\v 19 In your endurance you will gain your souls.

\s5
\p
\v 20 When you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its destruction is near.
\v 21 Then let those in Judea flee to the mountains, and let those who are in the middle of the city leave,  and do not let those who are in the country enter it.
\v 22 For these are days of vengeance, so that all the things that are written will be fulfilled.

\s5
\v 23 Woe to them who are pregnant and to them who are nursing in those days! For there will be great distress upon the land, and wrath to this people.
\v 24 And they will fall by the edge of the sword and they will be led captive into all the nations, and Jerusalem will be trampled by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.
\p

\s5
\v 25 There will be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars.  And on the earth, there will be distress of the nations, in despair from the roar of the sea and waves.
\v 26 There will be men fainting from fear and from expectation of the things which are coming upon the world. For the powers of the heavens will be shaken.

\s5
\v 27 Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
\v 28 But when these things begin to happen, stand up, and lift up your heads, because your deliverance draws near."

\s5
\p
\v 29 Jesus told them a parable, "Look at the fig tree, and all the trees.
\v 30 When they sprout buds, you see for yourselves and know that summer is already near. 
\v 31 So also, when you see these things happening, you know that the kingdom of God is near.

\s5
\v 32 Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away, until all of these things occur.
\v 33 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.
\p

\s5
\v 34 But pay attention to yourselves, so that your hearts are not burdened with debauchery, drunkenness, and the worries of life. For that day will come on you suddenly
\v 35 as a trap. For it will come upon everyone living on the face of the whole earth.

\s5
\v 36 But be alert at all times, praying that you may be strong enough to escape all these things that will take place, and to stand before the Son of Man."

\s5
\p
\v 37 So during the days he was teaching in the temple and at night he went out, and spent the night on the mount that is called Olivet.
\v 38 All of the people came early in the morning to hear him in the temple.





\s5 
\c 22
\p
\v 1 Now the Festival of Unleavened Bread drew near, which is called the Passover.
\v 2 The chief priests and the scribes discussed how they could put Jesus to death, for they were afraid of the people.

\s5
\p
\v 3 Satan entered into Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve.
\v 4 Judas went and discussed with the chief priests and captains about how he could deliver Jesus to them.

\s5
\v 5 They were glad, and agreed to give him money.
\v 6 He consented, and looked for an opportunity to deliver him to them away from the crowd.

\s5
\p
\v 7 The day of unleavened bread came, on which the Passover lamb must be sacrificed.
\v 8 Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, "Go and prepare for us the Passover meal, so that we may eat it."
\v 9 They asked him, "Where do you want us to make preparations?"

\s5
\v 10 He answered them, "Listen, when you have entered the city, a man bearing a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him into the house that he goes into.
\v 11 Then say to the master of the house, 'The Teacher says to you, "Where is the guest room, where I will eat the Passover with my disciples?"'

\s5
\v 12 He will show you a large furnished upper room. Make the preparations there."
\v 13 So they went, and found everything as he had said to them. Then they prepared the Passover meal.

\s5
\p
\v 14 When the time came, he sat down with the apostles.
\v 15 Then he said to them, "I have greatly desired to eat this Passover Festival with you before I suffer.
\v 16 For I say to you, I will not eat it again, until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God."

\s5
\v 17 Then Jesus took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he said, "Take this, and share it among yourselves.
\v 18 For I say to you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine again, until the kingdom of God comes."

\s5
\v 19 Then he took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and gave to them, saying, "This is my body which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me."
\v 20 He took the cup in the same way after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.

\s5
\v 21 But pay attention. The one who betrays me is with me at the table.
\v 22 For the Son of Man indeed goes as it has been determined. But woe to that man through whom he is betrayed!"
\v 23 And they began to question among themselves, which of them it was that would do this thing.

\s5
\p
\v 24 Then there arose also a quarrel among them about which of them was considered to be greatest.
\v 25 He said to them, "The kings of the Gentiles have lordship over them, and the ones who have authority over them are called honored rulers.

\s5
\v 26 But it must not be like this with you. Instead, let the one who is the greatest among you become like the youngest. And let the one who is the most important become like the one who serves.
\v 27 For which is greater, the one who sits at the table, or the one who serves? Is it not the one who sits at the table? Yet I am among you as one who serves.

\s5
\v 28 But you are the ones who have continued with me in my temptations.
\v 29 I give to you a kingdom, even as my Father has given a kingdom to me,
\v 30 that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom. And you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

\s5
\p
\v 31 Simon, Simon, be aware, Satan asked to have you, that he might sift you as wheat.
\v 32 But I have prayed for you, that your faith may not fail. After you have turned back again, strengthen your brothers."

\s5
\v 33 Peter said to him, "Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death."
\v 34 Jesus replied, "I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow this day, before you deny three times that you know me."

\s5
\p
\v 35 Then Jesus said to them, "When I sent you out without a purse, a bag of provisions, or shoes, did you lack anything?" And they answered, "Nothing."
\v 36 Then he said to them, "But now, the one who has a purse, let him take it, and also a bag of provisions. The one who does not have a sword should sell his cloak and buy one.

\s5
\v 37 For I say to you, what is written about me must be fulfilled, 'And he was regarded as one of the lawless.' For what is predicted about me is being fulfilled."
\v 38 Then they said, "Lord, look! Here are two swords." And he said to them, "It is enough."

\s5
\p
\v 39 After supper, Jesus went, as he often did, to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples followed him.
\v 40 When they arrived, he said to them, "Pray that you do not enter into temptation."

\s5
\v 41 He went away from them about a stone’s throw, and he knelt down and prayed,
\v 42 saying, "Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless not my will, but yours be done."

\s5
\v 43 Then an angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him.
\v 44 Being in agony, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down upon the ground.

\s5
\v 45 When he rose up from his prayer, he came to the disciples, and found them sleeping because of their sorrow,
\v 46 and asked them, "Why are you sleeping? Rise and pray, that you may not enter into temptation."

\s5
\p
\v 47 While he was still speaking, behold, a crowd appeared, with Judas, one of the twelve, leading them. He came near to Jesus to kiss him, 
\v 48 but Jesus said to him, "Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?"

\s5
\v 49 When those who were around Jesus saw what was happening, they said, "Lord, should we strike with the sword?"
\v 50 Then one of them struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.
\v 51 Jesus said, "Let this be enough." And he touched his ear, and healed him.
 
\s5 
\v 52 Jesus said to the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and elders, who came against him, "Do you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs?
\v 53 When I was daily with you in the temple, you did not lay your hands on me. But this is your hour, and the authority of darkness."

\s5
\p
\v 54 Seizing him, they led him away, and brought him into the high priest’s house. But Peter followed from a distance.
\v 55 After they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter sat in the midst of them.

\s5
\v 56 A certain female servant saw him as he sat in the light of the fire, and looked straight at him and said, "This man also was with him."
\v 57 But Peter denied it, saying, "Woman, I do not know him."
\v 58 After a little while someone else saw him, and said, "You are also one of them." But Peter said, "Man, I am not."

\s5
\v 59 After about an hour another man insisted and said, "Truly this man also was with him, for he is a Galilean."
\v 60 But Peter said, "Man, I do not know what you are saying." And immediately, while he was speaking, a rooster crowed.

\s5
\v 61 Turning, the Lord  looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, when he said to him, "Before a rooster crows today you will deny me three times."
\v 62 Going outside, Peter wept bitterly.

\s5
\p
\v 63 Then the men guarding Jesus mocked and beat him.
\v 64 After blindfolding him, they asked him, saying, "Prophesy! Who is the one who hit you?"
\v 65 They spoke many other things against Jesus, blaspheming him.

\s5
\p
\v 66 As soon as it was day, the elders of the people gathered together, both chief priests and scribes. They led him into the Council,
\v 67 saying, "If you are the Christ, tell us." But he said to them, "If I tell you, you will not believe,
\v 68 and if I ask you, you will not answer.

\s5
\v 69 But from now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God."
\v 70 They all said, "Then you are the Son of God?" And Jesus said to them, "You say that I am."
\v 71 They said, "Why do we still need a witness? For we ourselves have heard from his own mouth."



   

\s5
\c 23
\p
\v 1 The whole company of them rose up, and brought Jesus before Pilate.
\v 2 They began to accuse him, saying, "We found this man perverting our nation, forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ, a king."

\s5
\v 3 Pilate asked him, saying, "Are you the King of the Jews?" And Jesus answered him and said, "You say so."
\v 4 Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, "I find no fault in this man."
\v 5 But they were insisting, saying, "He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee even to this place."

\s5
\v 6 So when Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilean.
\v 7 When he discovered that he was under Herod’s authority, he sent Jesus to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem in those days.

\s5
\p
\v 8 When Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, because he had wanted to see him for a long time. He had heard about him and he hoped to see some miracle done by him.
\v 9 Herod questioned Jesus in many words, but Jesus answered him nothing.
\v 10 The chief priests and the scribes stood, violently accusing him.

\s5
\v 11 Herod with his soldiers insulted him, and mocked him, and clothed him in beautiful clothing, then sent Jesus back to Pilate.
\v 12 Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day (before they had been enemies).

\s5
\p
\v 13 Pilate then called together the chief priests and the rulers and the crowd of people,
\v 14 and said to them, "You brought to me this man like a man who is leading the people to act badly, and see, I, having questioned him before you, find no fault in this man concerning those things of which you accuse him.

\s5
\v 15 No, nor does Herod, for he sent him back to us, and see, nothing worthy of death has been done by him.
\v 16 I will therefore punish him, and release him."
\v 17 \f + \ft \f  The best ancient copies omit Luke 23:17, \fqa Now Pilate was obligated to release to the Jews one prisoner at the feast. \f*

\s5
\v 18 But they cried out all together, saying, "Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas!"
\v 19 Barrabas was a man who had been put into prison for a certain rebellion in the city and for murder.

\s5
\v 20 Pilate addressed them again, desiring to release Jesus.
\v 21 But they shouted, saying, "Crucify him, crucify him."
\v 22 He said to them a third time, "Why, what evil has this man done? I have found nothing deserving the death penalty in him. Therefore after punishing him, I will release him."

\s5
\v 23 But they were insistent with loud voices, demanding for him to be crucified. And their voices convinced Pilate.
\v 24 So Pilate decided to grant their demand. 
\v 25 He released the one they asked for who had been put in prison for rioting and murder. But he delivered up Jesus to their will.

\s5
\p
\v 26 As they led him away, they seized one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and they laid the cross on him to carry, following Jesus.

\s5
\p
\v 27 A great crowd of the people, and of women who grieved and mourned for him, were following him.
\v 28 But turning to them, Jesus said, "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.

\s5
\v 29 For see, the days are coming in which they will say, 'Blessed are the barren and the wombs that did not bear, and the breasts that did not nurse.'
\v 30 Then they will begin to say to the mountains, 'Fall on us,' and to the hills, 'Cover us.'
\v 31 For if they do these things while the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?"

\s5
\p
\v 32 Other men, two criminals, were led away with him to be put to death.

\s5
\p
\v 33 When they came to the place which is called The Skull, there they crucified him and the criminals, one on the right of him and the other on the left.
\v 34 Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing." And they cast lots, dividing up his garments.

\s5
\v 35 The people stood watching while the rulers also were mocking him, saying, "He saved others. Let him save himself, if he is the Christ of God, the chosen one."

\s5
\v 36 The soldiers also ridiculed him, approaching him, offering him vinegar,
\v 37 and saying, "If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself."
\v 38 There was also a sign over him, "THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS."

\s5
\p
\v 39 One of the criminals who was crucified, insulted him, saying, "Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us."
\v 40 But the other answered, rebuking him said, "Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence?
\v 41 We indeed are here justly, for we are receiving what we deserve for our deeds. But this man did nothing wrong."

\s5
\v 42 And he added, "Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom."
\v 43 Jesus said to him, "Truly I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise."
\p

\s5
\v 44 It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour
\v 45 as the sun's light failed. Then the curtain of the temple was split down the middle.

\s5
\v 46 Crying with a loud voice, Jesus said, "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit." Having said this, he died.
\v 47 When the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, "Surely this was a righteous man."

\s5
\v 48 When all the multitudes who came together to witness this sight saw the things that were done, they returned beating their breasts.
\v 49 But all of his acquaintances, and the women who followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.

\s5
\p
\v 50 Behold, there was a man named Joseph, belonging to the Council, a good and righteous man
\v 51 (he had not agreed with the decision and their action), from Arimathea, a Jewish city, who was waiting for the kingdom of God.

\s5
\v 52 This man, approaching Pilate, asked for the body of Jesus.
\v 53 He took it down, and wrapped it in fine linen, and laid him in a tomb that was cut in stone, where no one had ever been laid. 
\s5
\v 54 It was the Day of the Preparation, and the Sabbath was dawning.
\v 55 The women, who had come with him out of Galilee, followed after, and saw the tomb and how his body was laid.
\v 56 They returned, and prepared spices and ointments.
\p Then on the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.



   

\s5
\c 24
\nb
\v 1 Very early on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared.
\v 2 They found the stone rolled away from the tomb.
\v 3 They entered in, but did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.

\s5
\v 4 It happened that, while they were confused about this, suddenly, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel.
\v 5 As the women were filled with fear and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said to the women, "Why do you seek the living among the dead?

\s5
\v 6 He is not here, but is risen! Remember how he spoke to you when he was still in Galilee,
\v 7 saying that the Son of Man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men and be crucified, and on the third day, rise again."

\s5
\v 8 The women remembered his words,
\v 9 and returned from the tomb and told all these things to the eleven and all the rest.
\v 10 Now Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them reported these things to the apostles.

\s5
\v 11 But this message seemed like idle talk to the apostles, and they did not believe the women.

\v 12 Yet Peter rose up, and ran to the tomb, and stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths by themselves.  Peter then departed to his home, wondering what had happened.
\p

\s5 
\v 13 Behold, two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was sixty stadia from Jerusalem.
\v 14 They discussed with each other about all the things which had happened.

\s5
\v 15 It happened that, while they discussed and questioned together, Jesus himself drew near and went with them.
\v 16 But their eyes were prevented from recognizing him.

\s5
\v 17 Jesus said to them, "What are the two of you talking about as you walk?" They stood there looking sad.
\v 18 One of them, named Cleopas, answered him, "Are you the only person in Jerusalem who does not know the things which have happened there these days?"

\s5
\v 19 Jesus said to them, "What things?" They answered him, "The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, who was a prophet, mighty in deed and word before God and all the people.
\v 20 And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death and crucified him.

\s5
\v 21 But we hoped that it was he who would free Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things came to pass.

\s5
\v 22 But also, some women of our company amazed us, having been at the tomb early in the morning.
\v 23 When they did not find his body, they came, saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said that he was alive.
\v 24 Some men who were with us went to the tomb, and found it just as the women had said. But they did not see him."

\s5
\v 25 Jesus said to them, "Oh foolish men and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!
\v 26 Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things, and to enter into his glory?"
\v 27 Then beginning from Moses and through all the prophets, Jesus interpreted to them the things concerning himself in all the scriptures.

\s5
\v 28 As they drew near to the village, where they were going, Jesus acted as though he would go further.
\v 29 But they compelled him, saying, "Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is almost over." So Jesus went in to stay with them.

\s5
\v 30 It happened that, when he had sat down with them to eat, he took the bread, blessed it, and breaking it, he gave it to them.
\v 31 Then their eyes were opened, and they knew him, and he vanished out of their sight.
\v 32 They said one to another, "Was not our heart burning within us, while he spoke to us on the way, while he opened to us the scriptures?"

\s5
\v 33 They rose up that very hour, and returned to Jerusalem. They found the eleven gathered together, and those who were with them,
\v 34 saying, "The Lord is risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon."
\v 35 So they told the things that happened on the way, and how Jesus was shown to them in the breaking of the bread.

\s5
\p
\v 36 As they spoke these things, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and said to them, "Peace be to you."
\v 37 But they were terrified and filled with fear, and supposed that they saw a spirit.

\s5
\v 38 Jesus said to them, "Why are you troubled? Why do questions arise in your heart?
\v 39 See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Touch me and see. For a spirit does not have flesh and bones, as you see me having."
\v 40 When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.

\s5
\v 41 While they were still incredulous with joy, and wondered, Jesus said to them, "Do you have anything to eat?"
\v 42 They gave him a piece of a broiled fish.
\v 43 Jesus took it, and ate it before them.

\s5
\p
\v 44 He said to them, "When I was with you, I told you that all that was written in the law of Moses and the prophets and the Psalms must be fufilled."

\s5
\v 45 Then he opened their minds, that they might understand the scriptures.
\v 46 He said to them, "Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer, and rise again from the dead on the third day.
\v 47 And repentance and forgiveness of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.

\s5
\v 48 You are witnesses of these things.
\v 49 See, I am sending the promise of my Father upon you. But wait in the city, until you are clothed with power from on high."

\s5
\p
\v 50 Then Jesus led them out until they were near Bethany. He lifted up his hands, and blessed them.
\v 51 It happened that, while he was blessing them, he left them and was carried up into heaven.

\s5
\v 52 So they worshiped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy.
\v 53 They were continually in the temple, blessing God.
